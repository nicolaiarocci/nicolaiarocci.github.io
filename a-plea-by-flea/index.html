<meta name=keywords content="music,flea,nick cave,jazz,rhcp"><meta name=description content="I reluctantly admit that it was Spotify&rsquo;s Discover Weekly that let me discover Flea&rsquo;s new solo single, A Plea. It’s jazz, and it&rsquo;s beautiful. There are echoes of Fela Kuti and Sun Ra in it or, well, that was my first thought.
The lyrics may sound naive at first, but they&rsquo;re not. Instead, they strike me as lucid and match my general feeling about what&rsquo;s going on lately, the risks we&rsquo;re taking as a society, and what we should do to move beyond and improve ourselves.
