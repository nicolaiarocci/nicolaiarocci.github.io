behind as a programmer</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>I’ve never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There’s a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.

A remarkable step up from the previous year. I have not read so many books since 2015 (36), and I never read so many pages before. Having read a few comic books helps pump up the stats, I reckon, and I suspect switching to ebooks played a role, too, as reading is more accessible than ever.
I bought a first-edition Kindle back in the day, but never got around to using it much. After a few attempts to like it, it ended up in a drawer. Fast forward to 2025, I gave myself a second chance and got a Kobo Clara BW, a device I’m digging a lot. Yes, every time I finish an ebook I liked, I’m sad I cannot shelf it, but the advantages are many that I don’t think I’m going back to paper books anytime soon. There will be exceptions, I’m sure, but the norm will be ebook first.

Marco surprised me by telling me that on his flight from Brussels, he discovered and listened to “my podcast” on Spotify. I was stunned. I didn’t remember ever recording a podcast, even though I’ve given a few interviews here and there over the years.
During my usual morning walk today, I went to look for it, and there it was, an interview I had done in 2021 that I had completely forgotten about. I got over the initial embarrassment (it’s always strange to hear your own voice) and resisted the temptation to turn it off, listening to it all the way through. I must admit that it captures that moment in my professional life, and much of the content is still relevant, especially regarding my experience as an open-source author and maintainer and my transition from C# to Python and back.

Anyone who has read Tolkien’s letters will know that he is at his funniest when filled with rage, and The Bovadium Fragments is a work brimming with Tolkien’s fury—specifically, ire over mankind’s obsession with motor vehicles. Tolkien’s anger is expressed through a playful satire told from the perspective of a group of future archaeologists who are studying the titular fragments, which tell of a civilization that asphyxiated itself on its own exhaust fumes. Tolkien’s fictional fragments use the language of ancient myth, reframing modern issues like traffic congestion and parking with a grandeur that highlights their total absurdity. It is Tolkien at his angriest and funniest, making The Bovadium Fragments a minor treasure in his ever-growing catalog.

But I’m here for the closing piece of the soundtrack, the one you hear over the end credits: Don’t Go To Strangers, by JJ Cale. I immediately reached for Shazam while Serena looked it up on Spotify.
Now I’m spending this whole Sunday morning listening and reading about the artist and the Tulsa sound movement he originated. Despite his reticence and all-around low profile, he was no small feat and inspired many a great artist in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Just to get your bearings, he’s the original author of Cocaine later brought to fame by Eric Clapton.

It’s jazz, and it’s beautiful. There are echoes of Fela Kuti and Sun Ra in it or, well, that was my first thought.
The lyrics may sound naive at first, but they’re not. Instead, they strike me as lucid and match my general feeling about what’s going on lately, the risks we’re taking as a society, and what we should do to move beyond and improve ourselves. The video is 100% Flea, and it’s adorable (it is directed by his daughter).

Programming is a task. It’s one of many things you do as part of your work. But if you’re a software engineer, your actual job is more than typing code into an editor. The mistake people make is conflating the task with the role.
It’s like saying calculators replaced accountants. Calculators automated arithmetic, but arithmetic was never the job. The job was understanding financials, advising clients, making judgment calls, etc. The calculator just made accountants faster at the mechanical part. AI is doing something similar for us.
