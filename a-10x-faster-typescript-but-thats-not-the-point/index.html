I was fortunate enough to attend a few meetings with Hejlsberg at the Microsoft Campus in Redwood, and, well, emphasis and hyperbole are certainly not his style.

Of course, none of those would have been ideal, least of all C# (itself a Hejlsberg creature), but corporate reasons could easily have prevailed. Hejlsberg and his team could pick the best tool for the job. Go is the lowest-level language with a GC; it compiles natively on all platforms, has great parallelism support, and you can write excellent functional code with it. It says a lot about Microsoft, the cultural shift it has managed since the late 1990s and early 2000s, and how it stays relevant today, unlike many of its competitors of those times.\nI am concerned that by switching to Go, they will no longer dogfood the language. By their admission, maintaining that massive compiler codebase in TypeScript was instrumental in adequately developing the language. We’ll see how that pans out now that they’re not working TypeScript daily.\nI’ll end by quoting a YouTube commenter who nailed it in one sentence:\nImagine creating several languages but still choosing a different one for your compiler rewrite because it’s just the best tool for the job - absolute ego-less GOAT move.\n","wordCount":"364","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-03-15T07:47:30+01:00","dateModified":"2025-03-15T07:47:30+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://nicolaiarocci.com/a-10x-faster-typescript-but-thats-not-the-point/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Nicola Iarocci","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/ accesskey=h title="Nicola Iarocci (Alt + H)"><img src=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/avatar.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Nicola Iarocci</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/opensource/ title=code><span>code</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/speaking/ title=speaking><span>speaking</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/books-i-have-read/ title=library><span>library</span></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/nicolaiarocci title=newsletter><span>newsletter</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/index.xml title=rss><span>rss</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/archives/ title=archive><span>archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">A 10x faster TypeScript, but that's not the point</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-03-15 07:47:30 +0100 CET'>March 15, 2025</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg>Anders Hejlsberg</a> is a legend in my field, with Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C#, and TypeScript in his palmares.
