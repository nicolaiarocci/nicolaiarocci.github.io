Reflecting on the fragmentary history of the Czech nation and on its shaky
equilibrium (as it will be evident shortly after that), in 1967, the writer
asks, &ldquo;Is the cultural value of our people such as to justify its [nation]
existence?&rdquo; And to this question, he then adds a second one: &ldquo;will this value
suffice in the future to protect it from losing its sovereignty?&rdquo; West Europe&rsquo;s
failure to understand the dilemma and its substantial indifference to the fate
of the small eastern nations, which Russia&rsquo;s totalitarian giant will eventually
swallow up, are co-responsible for this loss of living identity and culture.</p><p>In the second text (1983), Kundera questions the &ldquo;disappearance&rdquo; of Europe as
an ideal horizon (but also as a concrete force): united in the Middle Ages by
the Christian religion, in the 18th century by Enlightenment philosophy, and in
the modern age by the culture at large, what shared values constitute its
foundation today? Perhaps technology and the entertainment industry?</p><blockquote><p>It is not, therefore, political boundaries (inauthentic, always imposed by
