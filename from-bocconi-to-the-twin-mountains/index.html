Bocconi (on the road to Muraglione

            Ponte della Brusia, Bocconi (FC)
        


It is a nice hike, with the ascent that becomes quite challenging in the final
part, towards the ridge tops, which, once reached, you&rsquo;ll follow for a long
time, partially on a forest road, before plunging back downhill, initially
following a lovely descending ridge da makes most of the descent quite pleasant.
During the ascent, several detours were necessary to get around the landslides
that originated during the infamous May floods (there are still several traffic
lights on the roadway leading up from Forlì, all due to the restoration works
following the flood). Hats off to the volunteers who maintain the trail: they
have had to work hard this year. At some point, they had to &lsquo;dug out&rsquo; complete
new sections to get around the more enormous landslides."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/from-bocconi-to-the-twin-mountains/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon16x16.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon32x32.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=mask-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/from-bocconi-to-the-twin-mountains/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://nicolaiarocci.com/from-bocconi-to-the-twin-mountains/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nicola Iarocci"><meta property="og:title" content="From Bocconi to the Twin Mountains"><meta property="og:description" content="Yesterday I went for a walk in the mountains.
