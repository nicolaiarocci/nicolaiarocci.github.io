<meta name=keywords content="books,links,proust"><meta name=description content="A long-sought first draft of Marcel Proust&rsquo;s &lsquo;In Search of Lost Time&rsquo; surfaced

a Tablet article titled Proust&rsquo;s Madeleine Was Originally a Slice Toast.
Being the Tablet &ldquo;a daily online magazine of Jewish news, ideas, and culture&rdquo;,
it makes sense that a good part of the article focuses on Proust&rsquo;s ambivalence
about his Jewishness. Still, there are many other interesting tidbits to be
learned. On the novel itself and its development, on some relevant characters
and their real-world counterparts, and Proust himself."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/prousts-madeleine-was-originally-a-slice-of-toast/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon16x16.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon32x32.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=mask-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/prousts-madeleine-was-originally-a-slice-of-toast/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://nicolaiarocci.com/prousts-madeleine-was-originally-a-slice-of-toast/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nicola Iarocci"><meta property="og:title" content="Proust's Madeleine Was Originally a Slice of Toast"><meta property="og:description" content="A long-sought first draft of Marcel Proust’s ‘In Search of Lost Time’ surfaced a few years ago.
