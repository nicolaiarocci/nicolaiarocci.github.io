The death of Ivan Ilyc, by Lev Tolstoy
★★★★☆
(La morte di Ivan Ilyc, Feltrinelli)
This work is a potent warning against the superficiality of life and a call to seek a more authentic and conscious existence. The main themes (and there are many for a booklet of a few pages, but that is what can be achieved by a giant of literature) are the inevitability of death, the hypocrisy of &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; society, alienation and loneliness, the meaning of life, and redemption through suffering. It is one of Tolstoy&rsquo;s minor works, the philosophical-religious period from his second and last periods. Admirable."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=http://localhost:59698/books-i-read-in-2025/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=http://localhost:59698/images/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=http://localhost:59698/images/favicon16x16.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=http://localhost:59698/images/favicon32x32.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=http://localhost:59698/images/favicon.ico><link rel=mask-icon href=http://localhost:59698/images/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=http://localhost:59698/books-i-read-in-2025/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:59698/books-i-read-in-2025/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nicola Iarocci"><meta property="og:title" content="Books I read in 2025"><meta property="og:description" content="[intro]

Admirable.\nLa scomparsa di Majorana, by Leonardo Sascia ★★★☆☆\nSince March 26, 1938, traces have been lost, between his departure and arrival on a sea voyage from Palermo to Naples, of the 31-year-old Sicilian physicist Ettore Majorana, whom Fermi would not hesitate to call a genius of the stature of Galileo and Newton. Suicide, as the investigators of the time want to believe and let belief, or voluntary escape from the world and the terrible fates that such a mind may have read into the future and the near future of science? In this admittedly speculative work, Sascia favours the latter. Sciascia’s arguments are intriguing but not entirely convincing to me. The value of this work lies in Majorana’s biography, which is well-documented and told. One is left wondering what Majorana could have achieved in his career if he hadn’t fled from it.\nThe Moon and the Bonfires, by Cesare Pavese ★★★★☆\n(La Luna e i Falò, Edimedia)\nThe Moon and the Bonfires by Cesare Pavese is a novel published in 1950 and is considered his masterpiece. The book explores several key themes, including:\nReturn and Memory: The protagonist, Anguilla, returns to his hometown in the Langhe after years of absence. The contrast between past and present becomes a central element of the narrative. Identity and Sense of Belonging: As an orphan who sought fortune in America, Anguilla questions his roots and whether he truly belongs anywhere. War and Its Consequences: In the aftermath of World War II, the novel highlights the scars left by the conflict, mainly focusing on the Italian Resistance and its impact on people and the land. Myth and Disillusionment: The moon and the bonfires symbolically represent the contrast between dreams and reality, between the desire for something more significant and the harsh truth of rural life. The Human Condition and the Inescapability of Fate – Pavese explores themes of solitude and the search for meaning, often portraying life with a melancholic and fatalistic outlook. The novel is intensely autobiographical and reflects Pavese’s existential concerns, offering a universal meditation on memory, identity, and the pain of existence.\nThis village where I was born, I believed for a long time to be the whole world. Now that I have indeed seen the world and know that it is made up of many small villages, I’m not sure if, as a boy, I was really that wrong.\nMornings in Jenin, by Susan Abulhawa ★★★☆☆\n(Ogni mattina a Jenin, Feltrinelli)\nI received this novel as a Christmas present from my kids, and I’m grateful to them for this powerful, passionate, eye-opening novel. Set against one of the twentieth century’s most intractable political conflicts, Mornings in Jenin is a deeply human novel of history, identity, friendship, love, terrorism, surrender, courage, and hope. Its power forces us to take a fresh look at one of the defining conflicts of our lifetimes.\nFor if life had taught her anything, it was that healing and peace can begin only with acknowledgment of wrongs committed.\nThe heartbeat of the wild, by David Quammen ★★★☆☆\n(Il cuore selvaggio della natura, Adelphi)\nAn annotated collection of memorable field reports written for National Geographic over nearly three decades by David Quemmen.\nHuman beings are the problem on this planet, but they are also the solution.\n","wordCount":"692","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-12-31T07:36:24+01:00","dateModified":"2025-12-31T07:36:24+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:59698/books-i-read-in-2025/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Nicola
