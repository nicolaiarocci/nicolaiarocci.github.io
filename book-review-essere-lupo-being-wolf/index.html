The tension of the stakeouts, the contemplation of the woods in the long waits, the excitement of a trail to follow, the
scents and sounds of a wilderness where everyone is alone in front of himself: <em>Being Wolf</em> tells of a predator in
harmony with his world and of the human who, inspired by it, questions and rethinks his place in nature. I found two
other themes well addressed: the hate and malice that often lurk beneath the surface of small, seemingly idyllic
communities and the comfort and serenity that a relationship of mutual trust, respect and love offers to aged partners
