      <description>Today, the New York Times‚Äô SundayReview features a great column by Matthew B. Crawford: The Cost of Paying Attention.
Attention is a resource; a person has only so much of it [‚Ä¶] What if we saw attention in the same way that we saw air or water, as a valuable resource that we hold in common? Perhaps, if we could envision an ‚Äúattentional commons,‚Äù then we could figure out how to protect it.</description>

      <description>Tom Christie has some very good things to say on how to successfully maintain an open source project without losing sanity.
Truth one: There are, and will always be, a non-finite number of possible valid issues to address. Your code can always be better polished, your APIs better defined, and your project more fully featured. Your documentation can always be better. The ecosystem within which your project lives is constantly evolving.</description>

      <description>In spite of being a marketing spin and link bait, Heroku article on microservices does a pretty good job at explaining why microservices matter and, at a very high level, what challenges they pose.
However, microservices aren‚Äôt a silver bullet, and they won‚Äôt make a sluggish IT organization fast. While individual services become more robust and less complex, the overall system takes on the many challenges of distributed systems at the network level.</description>

      <description>I am not a big fan of top tens but 10 Tips for Better Pull Requests is well worth reading.
A good Pull Request involves more than just some code. In most cases, there‚Äôs one or more reviewer(s) involved, who will have to review your Pull Request in order to evaluate whether it‚Äôs a good fit for inclusion in the code base. Not only must you produce good code, but you must also cater to the person(s) doing the review.</description>

      <title>The Obligation of The Programmer</title>

      <description>Robert C.Martin, of Clean Code fame, has something to say on the role of we programmers in today‚Äôs society.
We rule the world.
We don‚Äôt quite understand this yet. More importantly, the world doesn‚Äôt quite understand it yet. Our civilization doesn‚Äôt quite realize how dependent it has become on software ‚Äî on us.
He goes as far as suggesting a programmer‚Äôs code of conduct of sorts. Food for thought I guess, although I suspect we‚Äôre too much of a wild and scattered bunch for something like that to really stick.</description>

      <description>When Ballmer famously said, ‚ÄúLinux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches,‚Äù it was fair to characterize Microsoft‚Äôs approach to open source as hostile. But over time, forces within Microsoft pushed to change this attitude. Many groups inside of Microsoft continue to see the customer and business value in fostering, rather than fighting, OSS.

Without an understanding of what‚Äôs happening at a low level, my peers ran into issues [‚Ä¶] and had no idea what to do to debug them. This is a problem that stems from teaching people computer science but not teaching them how to code.

      <description>This oh so this.
If you look back over the decades at the many high-level complaints that have been leveled at Windows, one in particular sticks out: Unlike Mac OS, in particular, Windows has always attempted to satisfy every possible customer need, and as such it often provides multiple ways to accomplish the same thing. The result is a messy product, if you will, one that lacks the singular vision that is typically associated with the Mac and Apple‚Äôs other products.</description>

      <description>I can‚Äôt say I left the .NET Framework altogether as our main app was developed with .NET and we still maintain it on daily basis. Whenever applicable however, all the recent stuff is being done outside the walled garden.
The following Jonathan Oliver¬†totally resonates with my experience.
The .NET Framework was good. Really good. Until it wasn‚Äôt. Why did I leave .NET? In short, it constrained our ability to choose (which is a huge deal for me) and turned our focus inward toward the perceived safety of the nest instead of the helping us experiencing all of the possibilities out there in the big, wide world.</description>

      <title>Stateless Mindset</title>

      <description>Would it be possible (and advisable) for a person to deal with everyday matters as if he/she was a stateless machine?
Imagine if you as a person dealt with millions of requests a day from a thousand or so clients: if you had to keep track all those clients and the multiple requests they were making, it would drive you crazy. The burden of remembering would crush you.
This is what our lives are like.</description>

      <description>Dennis M. Ritchie ‚ÄòThe Development of the C Language‚Äô is one of those things any programmer should read soon or later, if nothing else for historic reasons.
C came into being in the years 1969-1973, in parallel with the early development of the Unix operating system; the most creative period occurred during 1972. Another spate of changes peaked between 1977 and 1979, when portability of the Unix system was being demonstrated.</description>

      <description>What we may not have realized is that once the browsers don‚Äôt suck, being an HTML and CSS ‚Äúguru‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a very marketable skillset. 80% of what made us useful was the way we knew all the quirks and intracries of the browsers. Guess what? Those are all gone. And if they‚Äôre not, they will be in the very near future. Then¬†what?
A lot of folks who came up from that time and headspace have diversified their skillsets since.</description>

      <description>We shouldn‚Äôt really trust this kind of statistics, I know, but when my favorite language comes out as a clear winner, I can‚Äôt resist and take them for good.
Python is the ‚Äúlanguage of the year‚Äù according to the PYPL index : it had the biggest¬†increase¬†in popularity share in 2013. PHP had the biggest decline. Meanwhile, Java continues to have the highest popularity share among the programming languages.</description>

      <title>We Need Coding in Schools, but Where are the Teachers?</title>

      <description>Maybe instead of Coder Dojos for kids, we should run them for their teachers.
We must build a team of dedicated teachers to support school coding programs. We do not rely on our students to absorb math from textbooks, online videos or math clubs; similarly, we cannot depend on every student to learn to code on their own, by using online tutorials and afterschool clubs. If coding becomes as fundamental as reading and writing, we need to create a system where everyone has an opportunity to learn, not just the few who probably would have learned it on their own anyway.</description>

      <title>Alex Gaynor ‚Äî About Python 3</title>

      <description>A very interesting read if you‚Äôre into Python. Eve has been Python 3 compatible for a while and honestl, I would be surprised to find that somebody is running it in production under Python 3.
Why aren‚Äôt people using Python 3?
First, I think it‚Äôs because of a lack of urgency. Many years ago, before I knew how to program, the decision to have Python 3 releases live in parallel to Python 2 releases was made.</description>

      <description>Number #3 on Praeclarum‚Äôs list hits home for me, but all his points are both valid and strong.
As a programming language nerd I had mixed feelings when Jon Galloway tweeted about Microsoft‚Äôs new programming language.
‚ÄúWhy are your feelings mixed?‚Äù I kept asking myself. I love new programming languages. I took an internship at Microsoft just so I could be closer to the people who made C#. I read language specs for fun.</description>

      <description>I barely knew Colin. He sat two offices down from me, but we never worked on anything together, never laid eyes on each other after 5 p.m. Our relationship consisted, in its entirety, of work-related small talk in the break room, his lunch rotating behind us in the microwave. Ding, stir, have a good rest of your day.

      <description>On seeing WarGames for the first time in the 1980s, I wondered which magazine it was. Later, after seeing it on TV and on VHS/DVD, the same question kept nagging at me. I believed that I would one day get to the bottom of this matter. I correctly assumed that the magazine was a real world magazine with a fake advertisement added to it. Through some effort and persistence I finally achieved my goal on 2013-02-24 at 5:30pm.</description>
