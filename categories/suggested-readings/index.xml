      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the New York Times’ SundayReview features a great column by Matthew B. Crawford: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/opinion/sunday/the-cost-of-paying-attention.html&#34;&gt;The Cost of Paying Attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention is a resource; a person has only so much of it […] What if we saw attention in the same way that we saw air or water, as a valuable resource that we hold in common? Perhaps, if we could envision an “attentional commons,” then we could figure out how to protect it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tom Christie has some very good things to say on how to successfully maintain an open source project without losing sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth one: There are, and will always be, a non-finite number of possible valid issues to address. Your code can always be better polished, your APIs better defined, and your project more fully featured. Your documentation can always be better. The ecosystem within which your project lives is constantly evolving. You will never run out of things you could work on. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Truth two: You have finite resources. Damn.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are an open source maintainer, contributor or even a user do yourself a favour and <a href="http://www.dabapps.com/blog/sustainable-open-source-management/">read what Tom has to say</a> on the subject. Tom is the creator and maintainer of the Django REST Framework, a hugely successful open source project so he really knows what he’s talking about. And for what is worth, his conclusions mirror mines.</p>
<p>On a completely unrelated note, I met Tom at EuroPython 2014. He was so nice to come and meet me minutes after I was done delivering my <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/nicola/eve-rest-api-for-humans">REST API for Humans</a> talk. Good vibes.</p>

      <title>Why Microservices Matter</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/microservices-matter/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In spite of being a marketing spin and link bait, Heroku &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2015/1/20/why_microservices_matter&#34;&gt;article on microservices&lt;/a&gt; does a pretty good job at explaining why microservices matter and, at a very high level, what challenges they pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, microservices aren’t a silver bullet, and they won’t make a sluggish IT organization fast. While individual services become more robust and less complex, the overall system takes on the many challenges of distributed systems at the network level. Despite their challenges, they’re here to stay because they map better than anything else to the software landscape of the future: parallel development, platform-as-a-service deployment, and ubiquitous use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Better Pull Requests</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not a big fan of top tens but &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/01/15/10-tips-for-better-pull-requests/&#34;&gt;10 Tips for Better Pull Requests&lt;/a&gt; is well worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good Pull Request involves more than just some code. In most cases, there’s one or more reviewer(s) involved, who will have to review your Pull Request in order to evaluate whether it’s a good fit for inclusion in the code base. Not only must you produce good code, but you must also cater to the person(s) doing the review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Some Thoughts on the new .NET (Redux)</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/some-thoughts-on-the-new-net-redux/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/some-thoughts-on-the-new-net-redux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like all those involved with the .NET ecosystem I’ve been slowly digesting the recent news on the whole thing going open source and cross platform. I’ve been jogging down a few notes in light of a future blog post, but then Jeremy Miller came out with his own &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeremydmiller.com/2014/12/02/some-thoughts-on-the-new-net/&#34;&gt;Some Thoughts on the New .NET&lt;/a&gt; which is almost exactly the post I wanted to write. So when he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started to associate .Net “classic” with seemingly constant aggravations like strong naming conflicts, csproj file merge hell, slow compilation, slow nuget restores, and how absurdly heavyweight and bloated that Visual Studio.Net has become over the years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So when he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve started to associate .Net “classic” with seemingly constant aggravations like strong naming conflicts, csproj file merge hell, slow compilation, slow nuget restores, and how absurdly heavyweight and bloated that Visual Studio.Net has become over the years.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is me. No it’s actually Jeremy but really it’s me. I also share his concerns on the future OSS .NET community him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So much of .Net is open source now and they even take contributions. Awesome, great, but my very first reaction was that it doesn’t matter much because <strong>the .Net community as a whole isn’t as participatory as other communities</strong> and that would have to change before ASP.Net vNext being OSS matters. It’ll be interesting to me to see if that changes over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m very involved with the Python language and its community. I released <a href="http://nicolaiarocci.com/opensource/">open source projects</a> for both platforms and frankly I’ve been shocked by the difference in culture between the two communities. I am really hoping that, in due time, .NET going open source will also cause its community to evolve as a whole.</p>
<p>And what about coding on a Mac (or Linux for the matter)? He goes on with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a couple years now of using a Mac, I’d really prefer to stay on that side of things and hopefully give my Windows VM much more time off. Mac OS being a first class citizen for the new .Net and the progress on the OmniSharp tools for Sublime or MacVim is going to make the new ASP.Net vNext runtime a much easier sell in my shop.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been working on a Mac for years, confining Windows on a VM, doing Python with Vim as much as possible. My God I love Vim. My Visual Studio runs VsVim (which is open source by the way). Even my Xamarin Studio on OSX runs in vi mode (which sucks unfortunately). I would never go back to a Windows machine but that does not mean that I don’ want to use C# or F#. Even these days most of my coding is C# in XS/OSX or Vim with OmniSharp, a project I’ve been experimenting with since when the plugin for Vim was released. So native .NET on OSX and Unix? Yes please.</p>
<p>I am in the process of writing a C# iOS application. The data layer is SQLite encapsulated in a Portable Class so we can use it on both Windows and iOS. The HTTP/REST client is also portable, <a href="http://nicolaiarocci.com/introducing-eve-net-httprest-client-humans/">open source</a> and consumed on both platforms. And now even the mobile UI is C# and portable between Android, iOS and Windows Phone thanks to Xamarin.Forms. If you ask me, the future looks bright.</p>
<p>You should read Jeremy post on <a href="http://jeremydmiller.com/2014/12/02/some-thoughts-on-the-new-net/">his site</a>.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert C.Martin, of &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Clean Code&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; fame, has something to say on the role of we programmers in today’s society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rule the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t quite understand this yet. More importantly, the world doesn’t quite understand it yet. Our civilization doesn’t quite realize how dependent it has become on software — on us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He goes as far as suggesting a programmer’s code of conduct of sorts. Food for thought I guess, although I suspect we’re too much of a wild and scattered bunch for something like that to really stick.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Nonetheless, he raises a very good point about the predominance of software in our society and the risk that soon or later someone will wake up and attempt to impose some sort of regulation on the profession.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This originally appeared on Quora and is well worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a good programmer is incredibly difficult and it doesn’t happen quickly. We can’t expect to plant some trees and have 2000-year-old redwoods grow overnight, regardless of the demand for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Ballmer famously said, “Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches,” it was fair to characterize Microsoft’s approach to open source as hostile. But over time, forces within Microsoft pushed to change this attitude. Many groups inside of Microsoft continue to see the customer and business value in fostering, rather than fighting, OSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python’s simple, easy-to-learn syntax can mislead Python developers – especially those who are newer to the language – into missing some of its subtleties and underestimating the power of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, this article presents a “top 10” list of somewhat subtle, harder-to-catch mistakes that can bite even the most advanced Python developer in the rear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Why doesn’t GitHub talk about their product roadmap?</title>

&lt;p&gt;Software development is mostly horseshit. We’re busy trying to build things, trying to estimate when things are done, trying to work with other humans to make sure you don’t break anything when you launch. All of these things can go horribly, horribly wrong without much malice or without much intention. It’s still very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the rub. Programming, like writing, painting, and music, is chiefly a creative endeavor not a technical one. Practice with any technology or language is useful as a means of learning tools and techniques, but it will not make you a substantially better programmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the problem with emphasizing computer science over learning to code. Without an understanding of what’s happening at a low level, my peers ran into issues […] and had no idea what to do to debug them. This is a problem that stems from teaching people computer science but not teaching them how to code. Learning to code isn’t just teaching people how to spell – it’s teaching people the meaning behind the words.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look back over the decades at the many high-level complaints that have been leveled at Windows, one in particular sticks out: Unlike Mac OS, in particular, Windows has always attempted to satisfy every possible customer need, and as such it often provides multiple ways to accomplish the same thing. The result is a messy product, if you will, one that lacks the singular vision that is typically associated with the Mac and Apple’s other products.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that AngularJS is winning the frontend framework war. It’s not to say there aren’t great, high quality alternatives out there, but few have gained so much developer mindshare that slow and conservative companies see it as a wonderful investment. And it’s all the better that normal developers actually love developing with it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Why I Left the .NET Framework</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/left-net-framework/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t say I left the .NET Framework altogether as our main app was developed with .NET and we still maintain it on daily basis. Whenever applicable however, all the recent stuff is being done outside the walled garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Jonathan Oliver totally resonates with my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The .NET Framework was good. Really good. Until it wasn’t. Why did I leave .NET? In short, it constrained our ability to choose (which is a huge deal for me) and turned our focus inward toward the perceived safety of the nest instead of the helping us experiencing all of the possibilities out there in the big, wide world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;… and a Great Person in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathy is your most important skill. Practice it with everyone you interact with, and everyone who interacts with your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility goes hand in hand with empathy. Be open to the possibility (likelihood, even) that you are wrong. Know that you will always be learning and improving. accept and own up to mistakes immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The less you fear being wrong, the more confident you can be. You are wrong about many things. You know very little about most things. Everyone else is exactly the same way. Embrace it. Always learn, always question, always adapt and grow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dennis M. Ritchie ‘The Development of the C Language’ is one of those things any programmer should read soon or later, if nothing else for historic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C came into being in the years 1969-1973, in parallel with the early development of the Unix operating system; the most creative period occurred during 1972. Another spate of changes peaked between 1977 and 1979, when portability of the Unix system was being demonstrated. In the middle of this second period, the first widely available description of the language appeared: The C Programming Language, often called the `white book’ or `K&amp;amp;R’ [Kernighan 78].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Web Standards Killed the HTML Star</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we may not have realized is that once the browsers don’t suck, being an HTML and CSS “guru” isn’t really a very marketable skillset. 80% of what made us useful was the way we knew all the quirks and intracries of the browsers. Guess what? Those are all gone. And if they’re not, they will be in the very near future. Then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of folks who came up from that time and headspace have diversified their skillsets since. Many are now programmers, or project managers, or creative directors, or business owners. But a lot of others are still making a go of it as an HTML and CSS guru, often in a comfortable job they’ve had for years. What happens when that gig comes to an end?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Python is the “language of the year” according to the PYPL index : it had the biggest increase in popularity share in 2013. PHP had the biggest decline. Meanwhile, Java continues to have the highest popularity share among the programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You have so many awesome things on your hard drive you built that it would blow the world away if only they knew. You created Facebook before there was Facebook and PayPal before there was PayPal. But recently I’ve heard you ask, “how can this junk software out there be so popular?”…why are all these idiots more successful than me?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>We Need Coding in Schools, but Where are the Teachers?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe instead of Coder Dojos for kids, we should run them for their teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must build a team of dedicated teachers to support school coding programs. We do not rely on our students to absorb math from textbooks, online videos or math clubs; similarly, we cannot depend on every student to learn to code on their own, by using online tutorials and afterschool clubs. If coding becomes as fundamental as reading and writing, we need to create a system where everyone has an opportunity to learn, not just the few who probably would have learned it on their own anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alex Gaynor — About Python 3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very interesting read if you’re into Python. Eve has been Python 3 compatible for a while and honestl, I would be surprised to find that somebody is running it in production under Python 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why aren’t people using Python 3?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I think it’s because of a lack of urgency. Many years ago, before I knew how to program, the decision to have Python 3 releases live in parallel to Python 2 releases was made. In retrospect this was a mistake, it resulted in a complete lack of urgency for the community to move, and the lack of urgency has given way to lethargy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Second, I think there’s been little uptake because Python 3 is fundamentally unexciting. It doesn’t have the super big ticket items people want, such as removal of the GIL or better performance (for which many are using PyPy). Instead it has many new libraries (whose need is largely filled by pip install), and small cleanups which many experienced Python developers just avoid by habit at this point. Certainly nothing that would make one stop their development for any length of time to upgrade, not when Python 2 seems like it’s going to be here for a while.</p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Number #3 on Praeclarum’s list hits home for me, but all his points are both valid and strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a programming language nerd I had mixed feelings when Jon Galloway tweeted about Microsoft’s new programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why are your feelings mixed?” I kept asking myself. I love new programming languages. I took an internship at Microsoft just so I could be closer to the people who made C#. I read language specs for fun. I write compilers for fun. I sell a programming language, interpreter, and IDE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;On seeing WarGames for the first time in the 1980s, I wondered which magazine it was. Later, after seeing it on TV and on VHS/DVD, the same question kept nagging at me. I believed that I would one day get to the bottom of this matter. I correctly assumed that the magazine was a real world magazine with a fake advertisement added to it. Through some effort and persistence I finally achieved my goal on 2013-02-24 at 5:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
