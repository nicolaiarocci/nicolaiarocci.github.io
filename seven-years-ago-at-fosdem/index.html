In front of me was sitting this friendly, obviously brilliant (if a little shy) guy from Switzerland. At some point, I don’t remember why, we were talking about PyPy, and getting technical about it. This guy was giving me a rundown on the ins-and-outs of PyPy, and well, I was surprised at how profound his knowledge was.

Right in front of you.” We all had a good laugh. The next round was on me.\nIt’s small moments like these that make attending (and presenting at) conferences worth it.\nPS. I had all the hints—the brilliant guy from Switzerland who knows PyPy like the back of his hand.
