When The Digital Antiquarian released his [System Shock retrospective][1]
earlier this year, I was in awe. System Shock was one of my favorite games back
in the day, and yes, in the quarrel between id Software's DOOM and Looking
Glass's System Shock, I was siding with the latter. I was so much more for
immersion and storyline than shoot 'em-ups. The Antiquarian article is
excellent. If you're into gaming history or, really, into computer's history,
I urge you to read it all.

As I read Maher's post, I thought it would be great to fetch the original
System Shock box from my sparse collection of now ancient video games and keep
it by my side as I kept reading (I am known for lending myself to such romantic
gestures.) I reached for the bookshelf. Microprose's Falcon 3.0 was there along
with Origin's Ultima VII Serpent Isle and a few others, but System Shock was
missing. It was released in 1994. I was 24. A lot of time has passed since
then, but heck, I was sure I bought that game at the time. I have fond memories
of many thrilling nights exploring the SHODAN-controlled space station. In the
following days, I spent quite some time rummaging through all my belongings:
bookshelves, drawers, garage shelves, even the cellar to no avail. The System
Shock box was lost. Along with the careless disposal of Charlie, my Commodore
64, the loss of System Shock was one of my computer griefs.

Then, yesterday I went to visit my parents at their place. I was with Anna, my
third kid. We were chatting about what sons and parents usually talk about on
Christmas break when my dad mentioned that he'd been reordering stuff around
the house and that I should probably take a close look at a couple of boxes he
put aside for me. They contained old things from when I lived with them. I went
to check on them. You never know; there might be some memorabilia like the
comics or the books I used to read. Imagine my surprise when the original
System Shock box surfaced out of the first box. Oh, joy! Best Dad's Christmas
present ever[^2].

 [^2]: The original price tag is still there.  In 1994, the damn thing cost a whopping 139.900 Italian Lire (â‚¬72). Pirating was wild in those days, and I won't negate that most of my mojo came from dark channels back then, but when a worthy game appeared, I was ready to pay homage to the authors.
