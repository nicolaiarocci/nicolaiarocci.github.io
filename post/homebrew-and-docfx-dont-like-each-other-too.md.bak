Another day another Homebrew incompatibility emerges, this time with [docfx][2], the technical documentation building
tool of reference in .NET space. I've been using docfx for years to build the [FatturaElettronica.NET][3] website, and it's
always been working without a glitch. Lately, however, my builds have been failing with strange errors I was too lazy to
diagnose until today when I decided to grasp the nettle and sort the whole thing out.

It took me an embarrassing time to realize that, while successful, my docfx updates (`dotnet tool update -g docfx`) were
being ignored. An old, Homebrew-installed version of docfx was being executed at my launches â€”a simple `which docfx`
revealed the issue. `brew uninstall docfx` finally set the updated, dotnet-installed version free of its chains, and it
is now merrily churning websites.

A similar issue emerged [between Homebrew and .NET 8 Preview][1] only a few days ago. Lesson learned I'm not installing
dotnet tools via Homebrew anymore. Or maybe, I might stay clear of Homebrew altogether.
