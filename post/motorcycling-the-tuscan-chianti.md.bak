Last weekend I attended *Eroica 2023*, a motorcycling event organized by the Italian branch of the [Triumph Owners
Motorcycle Club][2] I currently preside. We rode the [Eroica][1] route, a legendary gravel bicycle race that runs
through the most beautiful territories of the Tuscan Chianti region. It was glorious. The weather was perfect, the food
was incredible, and the close-knit party of thirty T.O.M.C.C. bikers had great fun. We all ended up covered in an
astonishing amount of powder.

*Eroica 2023* was the first in a series of events we'll run throughout the summer and fall. I'm looking forward to the
next ones.
