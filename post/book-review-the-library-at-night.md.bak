As any other bookworm worth its salt, I digested a generous amount of books on
books and the history of libraries. Alberto Manguel's The Library at Night was
last, and that is a pity. It probably arrived just a little too late on my
shelves. I wish I found it at the beginning of my reading journey when my
enthusiasm for libraries and their contents was pristine.

Manguel's writing is mesmerizing and capable. The lover of libraries and their
books (in that order because this text is more about libraries than the books
they contain) will undoubtedly fall into the rabbit hole and devour this book.

This book is a treasure chest filled with remarkable, carefully crafted gems.
With books like this one, I feel bad for not taking notes as I read. Each
chapter is on a topic: the library as power, as order, shape, shadow, mind,
workshop, and the list goes on. Some are more exciting than others, but overall
the selection is rich, varied, and original enough to keep the reader
entertained all along. The author's library, assembled during his whole life,
spent a "professional reader" (not kidding, as a teenager, he was reading books
for a now-blind Jorge Luis Borges) and collecting books all-along while moving
across three continents, is the recurring theme. One way or another, you'll
find it mentioned in every chapter, and for good reasons, because it must have
been formidable[^1].

The text mentions a remarkable number of ancient and modern authors with their
works. The author shows his culture, but not in a pedantic or annoying way. One
chapter is about the advent of digital libraries. I share his preference for
the printed form. He goes a great length into explaining why old school is
better, and I tend to agree with most of his reasoning. I think, however, that
he is too dismissive of the digital form. It brings so many previously
unthinkable features. He acknowledges some. It has always been my dream to own
both forms of all my books: printed and digital. If there were one service that
allowed me to buy both at once, at the same price, I would be all-in.

Last but not least, my favorite quote from the book:

> Immensely generous, my books make no demands on me but offer all kind of
> illuminations.

 [^1]: **Spoiler alert**. I researched into the matter. It turns out that Manguel's library counted 40,000 titles. In 2020, he [donated them all][2] to Lisbon's Centre for Research into the History of Reading.
