*Sanguina Ancora* (Still Bleeding) is not a biography but a passionate and
informative tribute to Dostoevsky. The nonlinear, not literary style works and
the continuous back and forth between Dostoevsky's epic and the author's own
experiences as a scholar and Russian literature enthusiast is probably a good
idea as it helps stress the actualness of Dostoevsky's opus. 

However, the continuous jumping in and out of the Russian's life, though
sympathetic at first, gets tedious over time. While immersed in Dostoevsky's
events, it is not always pleasant to be torn away only to end up in the Parma
lowlands for a few entertaining anecdotes (that these anecdotes tend to
gravitate around the author's other works adds to the discomfort.) 

That aside, the book contains precious information on Dostoevsky's life, opus,
Russian literature and society of the nineteenth century. Some random facts
from my reading notes:

- Dostoevsky's incredible tenacity in the face of early setbacks. The first
  translation he worked on was aborted near the end, having discovered that the
  novel had already been translated into Russian from French. The second was
  published in a Russian magazine but heavily cut and, worse, without
  attribution. Yet during all this time, he continued unceasingly, tirelessly,
  fervently, day and night work what would become his first novel, *Poor Folk*
  (an immediate hit.) 
- Writers in late 19th century Russia were astonishingly important. Tolstoy had
  founded a kind of religious cult. Young people would gather in the evenings
  to read Gogol. In those times, in Russia, writers were real stars.
- Russian literature began with Pushkin. Before him, in the eighteenth century,
  Russians who wrote did so by imitating the French and knew French better than
  Russian, as did all the Russian nobles and educated people of the time.
- Bulgakov, in *The Master and the Margarita*[^1], has one of his characters
  say that Dostoevsky is immortal.
- As great as the country is, there are no dialects in Russia. Also, Russian is
  a spoken language first, and only then a written language (the Russian
  alphabet has existed only since the 9th century, with Cyril and Methodius.)
- Russians elected a monument to Arina, Pushkin's nanny who told him fairy
  tales and made him love the language. She was illiterate.
- Dostoevsky is arrested and sentenced to death for reading a letter aloud and
  in public. With his comrades in his revolutionary circle, he undergoes a
  false execution, an experience he will later give to the protagonist of *The
  Idiot*. The five minutes the protagonist waits for the shooting is a
  transcendental experience.
- Lieutenant Frank Columbo, the protagonist of the famous TV show from
  seventies, is inspired by Porfirij Petrovic, the detective from *Crime and
  Punishment*.

I've got a lot of notes from this book, which is a good sign. Vasily Rizanov's
memorable quote on Dostoesky's writing, also reported in the book, is worth
mentioning:

> The miracle of Dostoevsky's writing lies in eliminating the distance between
> the subject (the reader) and the object (the author), by virtue of which he
> turns out to be the most familiar of all contemporary writers and, perhaps,
> even of future writers, of all possible writers.
