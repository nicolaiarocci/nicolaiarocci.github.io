As a non-native English speaker, presenting at conferences has always been super
challenging and intimidating. It's even worse now that we're forced into
online presenting because of the COVID19 situation. James Whittaker has a good
post on the topic, with great advice: 

> Remember, the inability to see and hear your audience is disconcerting but it
> doesnâ€™t mean you should give up. There are much bigger audiences in the wide
> world that you will not have local access to. Getting good at video
> presentations means expanding your audience and increasing your influence.
