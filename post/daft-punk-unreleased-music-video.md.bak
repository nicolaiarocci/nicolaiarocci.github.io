Julian Casablancas (The Strokes, The Voidz) says Infinity Repeating is "the last Daft Punk song, ever." The song was
recorded in 2013 as a demo and left unpublished until it was included in the 10th-anniversary edition of Random Access
Memories released a few weeks ago.

The video is a highly addictive masterpiece. Digging into the comments on YouTube, I found that someone attempted a
reconstruction of [all the citations included][1]. I'm especially fond of the 8-16-32-bit graphics animation section.
Another thing I learned is that Thomas Bangalter, formerly one-half of Daft Punk, [said][2] that his fear of artificial
intelligence was a factor in why the group split in 2021.
