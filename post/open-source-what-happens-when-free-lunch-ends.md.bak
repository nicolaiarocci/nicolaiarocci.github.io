The article I'm linking today is authored by Aaron Stannard and focuses on [the
drama currently going on in the .NET Open Source ecosystem][4]. We've all been
there. A dependency we took aeons ago goes unmaintained or changes its
licensing model. Why does this happen? Because at some point, projects need to
become sustainable or else they fail.

Case in point, IdentityServer. The license change was, in my opinion, long
overdue. The new agreement is very reasonable; the package remains free for
most users. I understand the so-called "Procurement Rage."

Procurement is undoubtedly an obstacle to open-source adoption within the
Enterprise. Yet, it is true that there is no such a thing as a free lunch.
Either be prepared to pay or send some value back to your dependencies, in one
form or another (the article lists several great options). The conclusion is
just perfect:

I subscribe to every single word. I find this case even more disheartening
because most protesters are asking Microsoft to roll their own alternative. No
gratitude or sympathy, nothing, really, for the people who worked hard for
years, covering complex and strategic subjects such as authentication and
authorization, providing excellent value for free.  Baby-crying and asking
Microsoft to "solve the problem" is so sad. It's also so typical of certain
Enterprise culture. They just don't understand open-source or, just for
convenience, they pretend not to get it.

It should also be mentioned that there already exist some valid, open-source,
IdentityServer alternatives (IS4 included.) These should be the default go-to
solution for those who abandon ship. The last thing we need is yet another
"official" package by the behemoth. If anything, we need more variance,
certainly not less.
