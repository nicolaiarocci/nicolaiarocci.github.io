> Not to know what happened before one was born is always to be a child.

I found this Cicero quote on *Lapham's Quarterly*'s [about page][1]. A little [research][2] dug out the supposedly
original version found in *Orator Ad M. Brutum* (46 BC). It goes like this:

> To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child. For what is the worth of human life,
> unless it is woven into the life of our ancestors by the records of history?
