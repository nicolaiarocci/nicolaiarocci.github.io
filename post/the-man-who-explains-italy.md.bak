The New Yorker, in *The Man Who Explains Italy*:

> The Italian podcaster Francesco Costa thinks that the foreign press’s
> fixation on creeping Fascism in the country is overblown and unhelpful. If
> the center-right coalition wins, “Will Italy be a police state? No,” he said.
> “Will it be very badly run? Yes.”

I've been following Francesco Costa for a few years. He's talented,
conscientious, brilliant, and gifted with good humor. He deserves to be
featured in The New Yorker.
