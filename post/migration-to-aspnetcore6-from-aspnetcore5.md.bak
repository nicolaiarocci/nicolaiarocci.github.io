David Fowler has a very informative gist up on GitHub. It's titled [Migration
to ASP.NET Core. NET6][3] and it's filled with details, recipes and FAQs on
migrating an ASP.NET Core 5 web app to ASP.NET Core 6[^4]. The focus is on the
new, streamlined hosting model, also known as Minimal APIs[^1]. To be clear,
You don't *have* to move to the new model. As the FAQ section emphasizes:

>  Do I have to migrate to the new hosting model
>
>  No, you don't have to. It's the preferred way to host ASP.NET Core
>  applications from .NET 6 and onwards but you aren't forced to change your
>  project layout. This means you can upgrade from .NET 5 to .NET 6.0 by
>  changing the target framework in your project file from net5.0 to net6.0.

.NET6 Release Candidate is out, so the guide is unlikely to receive updates,
but I'm sure that David will be ready to do so if required. 

We are about to release several brand new web services in the coming weeks.
They are all ASP.NET 5, currently in beta, but before release we're likely to
upgrade them to NET6. NET6 is LTS, NET5 isn't, and offers significant
advantages, remarkable [performance gains][2] included.

 [^4]: The Core tag was dropped in NET5, and it was a good move. The reason why the insist on using it with ASP.NET eludes me.
