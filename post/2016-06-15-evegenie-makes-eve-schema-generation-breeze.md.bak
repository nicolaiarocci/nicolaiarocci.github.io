Released by the nice folks at Drud, [EveGenie][1] is a tool for making [Eve][2] schema generation easier.

> Eve’s schema definitions are full of features, but can take a good amount of time to create when dealing with lots of complex resources. From our experience, it’s often helpful to describe an endpoint in JSON before creating it as an Eve schema. This allows you to make quick decisions about the structure of your entities without spending time moving schema code around. This is where EveGenie comes in. 

EveGenie saves time by creating a ready to use Python Eve schema from a very simple JSON representation of a set of resources.
