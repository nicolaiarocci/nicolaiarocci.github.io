Trade Wars 2002 was a  great 1991 online game I hosted on one of my BBSes [back
in the day][1]. Not sure if it was Lorien or Phoenix BBS; it might have been
the latter given the game's release date. I totally forgot TW2002 until
yesterday when I spotted this [1991: Trade Wars 2002][2] article on the *50
Years of Text Games* newsletter.

I humbly confess that, until yesterday, I never made the obvious connection
between TW2002 and Eve Online. That's quite startling considering that I've
been a beta player first and then an avid Eve player for a few years (Eve was
also the last game I seriously played on a computer.) 

In retrospect, what's surprising is that Station Interaction, possibly the best
trait of TW2002, never really made it to Eve Online (not in my playing
timeframe, at least).

And of course:

>The StarDock also holds secrets: the large menu of available commands doesn’t
show all the options available. Pressing a key not listed on the menu would
describe your character exploring the seedier, lesser-known parts of the
station. A particular unlisted key would lead you to a locked door and a secret
password which, once learned—from the grimy Trader, perhaps, or another
player—admits you to the Underground, where nefarious players can buy illicit
goods and coordinate against law-abiding Federation forces. 

Eve was (probably still is) a fantastic concept. I was Jexter the Caldari. With
my friend Fist, we founded a small roleplaying space-pirate group known as
Jokers. Back in our time, I think [we made the news][3].

But what we found always missing was space station interaction. Besides
a generic system-wide chat, nothing encouraged players to spend time (and
roleplay!) while their ships were docked at those stunning space stations.
That's something TW2002 nailed down to near perfection. I wish Eve had that. It
could have kept me in the game for far longer.
