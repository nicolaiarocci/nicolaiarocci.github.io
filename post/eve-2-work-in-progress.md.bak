I've been back at the forge working on Eve 2.0. Version 2 will support Python
3.7+ and drop Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6. It will bring support for PyMongo 4+ as
well, along with several other minor fixes and improvements ([changelog][1]).
It would be nice if you guys and gals, users of Eve, would give it a spin
before the release.

I know. I [recently][3] stated that Eve was in maintenance mode. All of
those considerations still apply, but what can I say? I want Eve 2 out.
