I had the opportunity to give my [RESTful WeB APIs and MongoDB Go For A Picnic][1] talk at both [MongoTorino][2] and [NoSQL Day][3]. The folks at PUG Friuli where so nice to record all the NoSQL Day sessions, so here you have it: the full length [video of yours truly speaking][4] to a fully packed room crowded with 120 very attentive attendees. 

Unfortunately audio is horrible and while all MongoTorino talks were in english, NoSQL Day was an italian-only event. The slide deck is in english however, and is available on both [SpeakerDeck][1] and [SlideShare][5].
