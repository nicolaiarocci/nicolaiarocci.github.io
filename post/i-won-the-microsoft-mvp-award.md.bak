I've just received news that I've been awarded the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award in the Software
Development category. It is an honor and a pleasure to be renewed for the eighth time. Being a Microsoft MVP means a lot
to me; I remember how intimidated I felt when I met MVPs at various events and how totally out of reach the title seemed
for someone like me. Besides my everyday work, I kept doing the things I loved:

- Work on my open-source projects
- Present at conferences and local meetups
- Write some articles here and there
- Blog as usual

Then, one day, someone nominated me for the award. I was surprised, baffled and thankful, and I did not expect to pass
the selection process. I was genuinely shocked when I received the first award. Being in the MVP program has been a
happy and rewarding ride, and I'm glad the journey continues for another year.
