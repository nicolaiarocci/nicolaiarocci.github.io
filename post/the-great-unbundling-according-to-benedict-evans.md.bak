As a non-native English reader, I had to look up the true meaning of
"Unbundling" as a neologism. According to Wikipedia

> Unbundling is a neologism to describe how the ubiquity of mobile devices,
> Internet connectivity, consumer web technologies, social media and
> information access in the 21st century is affecting older institutions
> (education, broadcasting, newspapers, games, shopping, etc.) by "break[ing]
> up the packages they once offered (possibly even for free), providing
> particular parts of them at a scale and cost unmatchable by the old
> order." Unbundling has been called "the great disruptor." 

Every year Benedict Evans, former Andreessen Howoritz partner and now
independent analyst, produces a big presentation digging into macro and
strategic trends in the tech industry. This year, *The Great Unbundling*.

> Covid brought shock and a lot of broken habits to tech, but mostly, it

> - technology and innovation will be much more widely spread. For that and
> lots of other reasons, tech is becoming a regulated industry, but if we step

I find this work to be worth studying. It draws a detailed, informed picture of
what happened in technology and the economy these last years. It also offers
insights, with some foresight, into what might come next.
