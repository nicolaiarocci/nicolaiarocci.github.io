Regarding space-related topics and scientific research, [Casey Handmer's blog][1] is one of my references. So when Casey
started his [Mars Trilogy Technical Commentary][2] and I learned about Kim Stanley Robinson's masterpiece, I was
instantly intrigued. In Casey's opinion, KSR's [Mars Trilogy][3] is "one of the finest works of literature ever
composed." It took a couple of weeks of futile resistance before I gave in and ordered the first book in the series, *Red
Mars*, a 420 pages tome that attempts to depict a scientifically credible human colonization of Mars[^4].

An incredible amount of research went into this book, and it shows. Still, there's never an overabundance of scientific
or nerdy details; quite the contrary, to be honest, and, at least to me, this is one of the book's weaknesses. It's
astonishing how pivotal moments in establishing the first human colony on the Red Planet are glossed over. One hundred
of Earth's best scientists travel to Mars to create the first human settlement. During their richly narrated, almost
two-year-long voyage, we get to know the main characters and learn the ins and outs of the first colonial spaceship.
Yet, when they finally reach the orbit, the reader is left with no clues on the undoubtedly dramatic first landing. The
settlement is already established in the next chapter, with a second one already in place on Phobos' surface.

Omitting details such as the first landing is undoubtedly an editorial choice. Given the time scope of the narrated
adventure (by the end of the trilogy, it will span a few centuries), it probably makes sense, but I couldn't help but
feel betrayed in some way. The story is more about how humans could establish a society and cultural identity in a
remote colony, how such a community develops over time, and, more importantly, how and why conflicts emerge with the
distant home first and within the settlement itself later on. While reading, I often thought, 'Hey, this all reminds me
of the  American colonization!' and then, 'I wonder how much percolated into S.A. Corey's *The Expanse*,' terraforming
and Earth-Mars trouble playing prominent roles in both series. In many ways, and I know I am making enemies now, *Red
Mars* could have served well as a prequel to *The Expanse*[^5].

One thing I found confusing at first but later came to appreciate is that the story isn't told from a single person's
perspective. Instead, it sprawls across an extensive cast of characters as it expands over time. Viewpoints shift from
one character to another, and people we thought we understood suddenly seem strange and different when seen through
someone else's eyes. The Mars society is messy, very human, and often petty, with few clear answers and no simple
solutions. In *Red Mars*, we don't get an optimistic portrayal of the future of human society. Here, *Star Trek*'s
pacified civilization and the idealistic United Federation of Planets are far away to come, if ever.

Overall, I liked this book, probably a lot, but I don't think I will read the next installments in the series, at least
not right away. Maybe in a while, when Mars dust has settled.

[^4]: *Red Mars* was first published in 1992. That's something to be considered when evaluating it. Also, some details tenderly show its age, like when characters look at 'videotapes' recorded by remote satellites and surface cameras.
[^5]: *Disclaimer*: I never read *The Expanse*; I only watched and loved the TV show. So yeah, I don't qualify for an informed opinion on that franchise, let alone compare it with another one.
