For decades Scandinavian countries have been renowned for their educational
systems, low levels of corruption, sustainable economy, social justice, overall
quality of life. According to [Jukka Savolainen on Slate][1], the reason why
Finns have now been dominating the World Happiness Report four years in a row
has little to do with these factors and more with their life expectations.

Savolainen perspective is interesting because he is a Finn living in the US. He
experienced the Scandinavian system first hand, then moved to a (very)
different culture.

In comparing the different lifestyles, he also touches on the social
differences. Scandinavian people are not famous for their openness or the
quality of their small talk, that's for sure. I do admire their low-aspirations
attitude, which is well described in the article.

I have always been fascinated by the North. When I went to Stockholm to present
at Pycon Sweden, I fell in love with the city. I was lucky, though. We were in
May, and the weather was beautiful all week. Daylight lasted until midnight. To
my enthusiasm, the locals objected I should come back in the winter season to
really appreciate what living in the North entails. As a Mediterranean guy,
I imagine I might soon feel the long for warmer climates and still, the dream
of moving North persists.
