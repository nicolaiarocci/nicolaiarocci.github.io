Flask 2.0 has just been released. Along with it come many other major satellite
releases: Werkzeug 2.0, Jinja 3.0, Click 8.0, ItsDangerous 2.0, and MarkupSafe
2.0. 

Across all projects, Python 3.6+ is now required, and comprehensive type
annotations are supported. At a glance, I'd say that the biggest news is async
views in Flask 2. Work has also been done around Werkzeug `Request` and
`Response` classes to allow for better sync and async in the future (it's not
a public API yet.) Jinja, Click and ItsDangerous come with a lot of new
niceties. Details are available on the [Pallets website](https://palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-2-0-released/).

Flask is, of course, the giant on which shoulders the whole [Eve][1] project rests.
To say that the Pallets team has been working hard at the forge is an
understatementâ€”huge congrats to all of them.
