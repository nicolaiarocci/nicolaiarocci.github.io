As someone who's been on board with Twitter since 2009, I have to admit that
I'm *very* concerned with recent developments. I admire and respect Elon Musk
for his companies' achievements, especially in space and electric movement
industries, but the man himself, holy cow, what a drag. 

On The Verge, Nilay Patel's brutal piece on the recent Twitter acquisition is
chock-full of brilliant insights on what it takes to run a modern commercial
social service.

> You fucked up real good, kiddo. Twitter is a disaster clown car company that
> is successful despite itself, and there is no possible way to grow users and
> revenue without making a series of enormous compromises that will ultimately
> destroy your reputation and possibly cause grievous damage to your other
> companies.

> I say this with utter confidence because the problems with Twitter are not
> engineering problems. They are political problems. Twitter, the company,
> makes very little interesting technology; the tech stack is not the valuable
> asset. The asset is the user base: hopelessly addicted politicians,
> reporters, celebrities, and other people who should know better but keep
> posting anyway. You! You, Elon Musk, are addicted to Twitter. Youâ€™re the
> asset. You just bought yourself for $44 billion dollars.
