Antoine Roquentin, the protagonist of the novel, is a former adventurer who has
been living for three years in Bouville, a fictional French seaport town,
researching the life of an 18th-century diplomat. During his previous life
around the world, Antoine has seen many places, met many interesting people,
done exciting things. For the last three years, however, he's been alone in
Bouville. He has no friends and no desire to make some or meet anyone. He's
interested in nothing, not even in his work that he keeps neglecting. His days
are mostly spent walking around town, listening to conversations and observing
people around him. A "sweeting sickness" he calls nausea increasingly impinges
on almost everything he does and enjoys.

He has a relationship with a woman, but it is exclusively carnal: the two
exchange almost no words. Selt-Taught Man, an individual who spends his time at
the local library reading all books in alphabetical order, is one of his few
acquaintances. When Self-Taught Man invites Antoine for lunch, he notes on his
diary: "I had as much desire to eat with him as I had to hang myself." Antoine
has no interest in relationships. They take too much effort.

Antoine feels like he never lived but only existed. These days, we would
probably call Antoine's sickness with a different name, depression maybe. If
you ever felt like Antoine, Nausea is going to be a difficult read. If you
didn't, I suspect it will be hard for you to feel any sympathy for the
protagonist. Sartre writes beautifully, with razor-sharp precision. Despite his
attempts to refuse it, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1964. Nausea was
Sartre's debut novel, and he always considered it his best fictional work.
Nausea, by Jean-Paul Sartre, is a challenging but rewarding read. I think
Sartre goes straight amongst the masters at describing the human condition.
