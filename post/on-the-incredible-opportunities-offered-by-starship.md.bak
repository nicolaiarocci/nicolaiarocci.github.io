Space-junkie me is back, this time reading about the innumerable opportunities
that SpaceX's Starship will offer once it becomes operational, hopefully no
later than this year or the next. In his [Science Upside for Starship][1], the
exceptionally knowledgeable Casey Handmer makes a case for Starship relevance
in the future of space exploration by listing an astounding number of
reasonable use-cases for the vessel.

It's long-form, yes, but well worth it. Oh, and while you're at it, you might
as well read [Starship is Still Not Understood][2], Casey's previous article on the
topic.
