As I was browsing my RSS feed this morning, I came across a [new blog][1] from
Nat Friedman over at GitHub. The piece was titled "Open source goes to Mars",
and, of course, it caught my interest. In the article, Nat announced a Mars
2020 Helicopter Mission badge added to GitHub profiles contributing to
open-source projects and libraries used by Ingenuity. Some time ago, like many
others, I was granted the Arctic Code Vault badge, so I am familiar with the
concept. I quickly dismissed the information as "nice, not gonna get it" and
moved along.

Later during the day, I got a mail from an Eve contributor. In between other
things, he briefly congratulated me on my new GitHub badge. I went to check my
profile, only to find that, indeed, I am a Mars Helicopter Contributor. I was
bewildered. To my knowledge, I never worked on something even remotely related
to the Ingenuity mission. 

Years ago, I received a package from a software team at a private space agency
whose name I cannot tell. They sent me a lot of cool swag and a hand-written
letter signed by all team members. In it, I learned that they had been using
one of my open-source projects with success. They added that I should take
pride, as my work was used in one of their renowned space ships projects. The
package was their way to express gratitude. If you've attended any of my talks
in the past, you probably know this story. You might have seen me wearing one
of their t-shirts too. I knew my work was used in many places; I certainly did
not expect it was contributing to a space ship program.

So when I reached for my profile page on GitHub today, I was confused, yes, but
not wholly unprepared. And indeed, there it is, the new, shiny Mars Helicopter
Contributor badge. A quick investigation revealed that I earned it as a Flask
contributor. To be honest, I don't even remember contributing to it[^2]. I know
I've used it extensively, of course, as [Eve][4] inherits from and builds on it.

So, what to make of all of this? I am happy, of course. I have a badge of
honor to show off to my kids later this evening. I appreciate the intent:

> “Many of the people who are getting a badge probably have no idea their
> software is being used to fly a helicopter on another planet,” says GitHub
> Senior Director of Developer Relations Martin Woodward. “We wanted to make
> sure everyone was recognized for their contributions to this incredible human
> achievement.” ([source](https://github.com/readme/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter))

These badges surely help raise awareness of open-source relevance in the
modern-day world. I am grateful for it. I have to say, however, that I am not
a fan of the current gamification process going on at GitHub. I cringed when
I saw the "How do you feel today" box in my profile page a while ago[^3]. This
Achievements feature looks good on the surface. Still, it leans itself to be
leveraged in many different, even subtle ways. Let's hope for the best.
