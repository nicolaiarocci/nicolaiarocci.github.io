Last February I published [The State of Eve REST Framework][1]. Among other
things in that post, I mentioned that I was looking for ways that would allow
me to allocate more time to the project (and its satellites).

Well, I went and looked at the possibilities, and finally settled down on
a model which would probably be best defined as a blend between the Vue.js and
the Django REST framework models.

Effective now, the Eve REST framework, Cerberus, and the whole eco-system are
[collaboratively funded projects][2]. If you run a business and are using
either Eve or Cerberus a revenue-generating product, it would make business
sense to sponsor their development: it ensures the project that your product
relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. Individual users are also
welcome to make either a recurring pledge or a one-time donation if Eve and/or
Cerberus have helped you in your work or personal projects. Every single
sign-up makes a significant impact towards making Eve possible. 

Rest assured, Eve continues to be open-source and permissively licensed.
It is also maintained and developed in my free time, and by the awesome
community which has matured around it. I firmly believe, however, that it is in
the commercial best-interest for users of the project to invest in its ongoing
development (make sure you check the exciting *Things I Would Be Working On*
section on the Patreon page). 

To join the backer ranks, check out [Eve campaign on Patreon][2], or donate via

Thank you, *Nicola*.
