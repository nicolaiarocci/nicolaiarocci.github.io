*Nerdy prelude.* Local Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) were all the
range when I was a teenager. With my group of local hackers, we hacked our way
into ITAPAC, the then-leading Italian packet-switching network (we are talking
pre-Internet era here.) Via ITAPAC, we'd connect to so-called "out-dial
systems" in the USA. From one of those, we'd finally call our target BBSes with
a local call at no cost. We felt so invincible! I signed up on Channel One BBS;
I think that was the name. This particular BBS was located in Cambridge, MA,
and was chock-full of public domain and shareware I could download. Anyways,
the SysOp sent me a postcard confirming my signup (an old-school paper postcard
delivered via international postal service). Receiving a postcard from the US
was exciting in itself, but what was startling was a handwritten note on the
postcard. It said, "Ravenna, city of beautiful mosaics." I was shocked that
someone from Cambridge, MA, would know about my tiny, little hometown's mosaics
and let me know. 

While Ravenna is relegated to a marginal role in the modern age, it played
a very significant one in ancient times. Quoting from the from the
backcover of the book:

> In 402 AD, after invading tribes broke through the Alpine frontiers of Italy
> and threatened the imperial government in Milan, the young Emperor Honorius
> made the momentous decision to move his capital to a small, easy defendable
> city in the Po estuary - Ravenna. From then until 751 AD, Ravenna was first
> the capital of the Western Roman Empire, then that of the immense kingdom of
> Theoderic the Goth and finally the centre of Byzantine power in Italy.

In her tome, Judith Herrin tells Ravenna's story from its time as the capital
of the Western Roman Empire to the late 8th century, when it inspired
Charlemagne's imperial and religious building projects in Aachen. This book's
576 pages are packed with dense information. Many political, military, and
spiritual characters' in-life achievements and troubles build a complicated
narrative spanning four centuries. It helps that small, titled sections within
each chapter offer a palatable framework. 

Herrin's monumental work is one to be admired and respected. I was especially
delighted when Pippin and his son Charlemagne came into play in the book's
final part. As I've read [King and Emperor, A New Life of Charlemagne][1]
recently, I could merge knowledge from the two works. The flow of events that
originated with the demise of the Western Roman Empire and, centuries later,
led to the first glimpse of "Europe," as we intend it today, is much clearer
now.

Of Ravenna's glorious byzantine age, only the beautiful mosaics and the
baptisteries and churches containing them have survived for today's visitors to
enjoy.
