I just released a long overdue update to [Eve.NET][1]. This release marks a significant improvement over the previous one, which was more a prototype than a real package. New features are as follows:

  * `PostAsync()` supports bulk inserts
  * `DeleteAsync()` supports bulk deletes
  * `GetAsync()` has a `softDelete` option to include soft-deleted documents with query results
  * `GetAsync()` has a `rawQuery` option to pass raw Eve queries to the server
  * `BearerAuthenticator` class adds support for Bearer Token authentication

Several fixes made it into this release and, most importantly, I switched to portable Profile259 which offers support for the following platforms: Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, WinPhone 8.1, Windows 8, .NET 4.5+. Yes, that means no more support for .NET 4.0. See the [changelog][2] for details.

Eve.NET v0.2 is on NuGet so you can install it either from Visual Studio or with the Package Manager console. Enjoy!
