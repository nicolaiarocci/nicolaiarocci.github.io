I'm a Moka guy, always have been. Admittedly, I also like so-called American
coffee and, of course, espresso. But every day at my place, I'll have
a Moka-brewed coffee. Twice. As I wake up, and then in the afternoon before
getting back to work. I've been observing the pods frenzy spreading all around
me with curiosity and bewilderment in recent years, with dedicated retailers
opening (and often closing soon after) everywhere in my town. Bialetti's Moka
coffee pots have always been around my life. Not disposable, for they are
pretty expensive even here in Italy, but common, everyday kitchen gadgets?
Absolutely.

So it was interesting to read Atlas Obscura's [The Humble Brilliance of Italy's
Moka Coffee Pot][1] to learn more about Moka's roots, history (with the ups and
downs), and design relevance. Of all this stuff, I was only marginally aware.

> commonplace to the point of ubiquity not only in Italy but in Cuba,
> Argentina, Australia, and the United States. It's also widely misunderstood
> and maligned, with approval in the modern coffee world coming perhaps a bit
> too late, in only the past few years. Get one while you can.
