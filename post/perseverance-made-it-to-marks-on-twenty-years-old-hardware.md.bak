I'm a space junkie. So tonight, like all the other space junkies on the planet,
I watched in awe as Perseverance seamlessly and beautifully landed on the
surface of Mars. This is a phenomenal achievement. Of course, I will eagerly
follow her[^1] progress.

As I was following the live broadcast, I wondered: What kind of hardware and
software runs all this incredible technology? It was launched in 2020, so it
must be some cutting-edge stuff. As it turns out, that isn't really the case.

Perseverance computer uses the BAE RAD750 radiation-hardened single board
computer[^2]. Released twenty years ago (2001), the RAD750 is based on the
PowerPC 750, designed by IBM and Motorola and released in 1997[^3]. The exact
same computer is mounted on Curiosity[^4], which launched ten years ago.

From the same source, we learn that at least good-ole RAD750 is not left alone:

> The 'old school' RDA750 computer will work in tandem with a series of
> field-programmable gate array (FPGA) computers to control such things as the
> drivetrain, wheels, suspension and cameras. 

I could not find any reliable information on the programming languages
involved. I am guessing a mix of C/C++ and maybe Ada, as is typical of the
aerospace industry. The operating system itself is VxWorks[^5], a real-time
operating system initially released in 1987. This is a fascinating piece of
software.

Two considerations come to mind. First, and I am repeating myself here, what
a phenomenal achievement this landing is. As we watched the broadcast, I told
my wife: these guys are literally making the future of humanity. What did
I know that they're making it on twenty-year-old technology. Second. We,
ordinary people, might all be using way more power (and grid) than is really
needed.

*Updated on February 23th, 2021:*

On Monday, NASA released [a video][7] of Perseverance's descent to the red
planet. If it looks like aliens are descending on the surface, it's because,
well, that is what happens. We are the aliens. NASA also released an absolutely
mind-blowing [recording][8] of sounds from Mars's surface.
