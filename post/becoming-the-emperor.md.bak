Today, probably not just by coincidence, I came across [Becoming the Emperor][1], an
excellent New Yorker piece from 2005 on Memoirs of Hadrian, Yourcenar's other
works, and her peculiar career and life trajectory. Having just read the
Memoirs, I was glad to see several of [my reading impressions][2] confirmed.
I found the New Yorker article to be spot-on on Yourcenar's prose and theme:

> Actually, some of Yourcenar’s prose is marmoreal, but not so that you can’t
> get through it. Also, it is beautiful. What made her remarkable, however, was
> not so much her style as the quality of her mind. Loftiness served her well
> as an artist: she was able to dispense love and justice, heat and cold in
> equal parts. Above all, her high sense of herself gave her the strength to
> take on a great topic: time.

I was caught off-guard by the idea, conceived by many critics, that her writing
style resembles a man rather than a woman.

> First, many of her narratives were set in the past. Second, they often
> involved towering passions compacted into tight, steel-band forms. [...] She
> continued to embrace anti-sentimentality; indeed, she showed a fondness for
> brutality. And those traits, together with her highly controlled prose,
> encouraged reviewers to say—as they would say throughout her life—that she
> wrote like a man. As one critic put it, he could not find in her work “those
> often charming weaknesses... by which one identifies a feminine pen. The
> hand does not yield, it does not caress the paper; it is clasped by an iron
> gauntlet.” This opinion was fortified by the fact that most of her
> protagonists were men.

Intriguing and, now that I have been enlightened, shareable.
