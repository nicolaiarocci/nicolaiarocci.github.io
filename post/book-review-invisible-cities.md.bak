Invisible Cities is a collection of thoughts taking the form of cities or
cities taking the form of thoughts. It is an aesthetic and allegorical
description of some fictional, mostly surreal cities. Some of the portrayals
are fabulous: these cities suddenly come to life in the reader's mind thanks to
Calvino's mastery, who manages to materialize absurd cities, which have nothing
of the cities we are used to observing day after day; yet they appear to us
almost natural, absolutely possible, and charged with a suggestiveness that no
earthly city could have. In addition to the vivid images, however, we will be
confronted with the thought that the shapes of those cities give rise to the
figure of their inhabitants, who may represent various sides of human nature.

I can't help but think of suggestive architectures mentioned in other works,
like Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast series or Hayao Miyazaki's animes. In Peake and
Miyazaki, architecture plays a fundamental and often active role (think of
Howl's Moving Castle). Likewise, Calvino's Cities are absolute protagonists,
while Marco Polo and the khan are mere means to the narration.

Invisible Cities is one of Calvino's best works. Like others of his, it might
even appear light to the superficial reader while it's chock full of precious
insights and profound thoughts delivered by a master at the art.

> The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it

> for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no
> longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and
> apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of
> inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space. ― Italo
