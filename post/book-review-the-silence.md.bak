What happens when our technology suddenly abandons us? In this novella, DeLillo
explores the immediate consequences of such an event. It's a brief exploration,
though. We don't get to go too far into the story. The book ends abruptly, and
we're left stranded there, pondering and wondering. I imagine this is
intentional. Upon reflection, I concede the author's goal is achieved, but
I have to say, my immediate feeling is unfinished work. 

The writing meets DeLillo's high standards. If you've read him before, you'll
recognize his peculiar style at first sight. The idea is also good, albeit not
super-original.

I found The Silence to be good, but not as good as I expected. After reading
Underworld, the bar is set pretty damn high. Anything from DeLillo should
pertain to the mind-boggling department. This novel fits more in the ok
department. It could serve as a great, gentle introduction to DeLillo, though,
as his other works can indeed be intimidating.
