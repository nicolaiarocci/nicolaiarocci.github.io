If you are a grumpy old geek like me, you are probably a sucker for vintage
computer games too. I don't play games. Not anymore. I still enjoy reading
about them, though. I guess it's mostly nostalgia. I also believe that the
mid-80s up to the mid-90s really was the golden age of computer games. In my
book, innovation started with Infocom's text adventures and soft-ended with
Origin's Ultima Online. After that, it's been a constant evolution. "Harder,
better, faster, stronger", yes, but hardly a revolution.

My pusher of digital memorabilia is Jimmy Maher, also known as [The Digital
Antiquarian][5]. One month ago, he wrote a [fantastic article][3] on Origin's
Ultima VIII Pagan. Then, just the other day, he doubled down with a [terrific
piece][4] on Looking Glass' System Shock. Both are games I played fervidly[^1]. 

Maher is not kind to Pagan:

> But then, for the eighth game in the mainline Ultima series, Origin decided

> in which you never went to Britannia at all, but stayed instead on

> game adventuring alone (after all, who would want to adventure with a jerk
> like you?); in which the core mechanics were jumping between pedestals like
> Super Mario and pounding your enemies over the head with your big old hammer.

It hurts to admit it, but he's exactly right. Nonetheless, I enjoyed exploring
Pagan's world. When I later joined the Ultima Online Beta, it was amazing to
see that the same graphic engine and all of Pagan's art were recycled. 

![System Shock](/images/system-shock.jpg#right)
System Shock was a game I loved. I found it to be revolutionary. Games like
this one were precisely the kind of entertainment I strived for: immersive
simulations.

I have always been a System Shock guy more than a DOOM person. I really like
how Maher compares the two games and the software companies that produced them,
more or less in the same time-span[^2]. 

In Maher's reconstructions, what I find to be more appealing is not the games
themselves with their mechanics but rather the history behind them. How the
dev-team conceived and then developed their projects.

After so many years, I am thankful to Maher for bringing these two games back
to memory. Now, I am impatiently waiting for his Ultima Online installment.
I know it *must* be on his list, right?
