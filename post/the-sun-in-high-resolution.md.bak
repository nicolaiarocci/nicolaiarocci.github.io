![The Sun in high resolkution](/images/the-sun.png)

> The Sun as seen by Solar Orbiter in extreme ultraviolet light from a distance
> of roughly 75 million kilometres. The image is a mosaic of 25 individual
> images taken on 7 March by the high resolution telescope of the Extreme
> Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument. Taken at a wavelength of 17 nanometers,
> in the extreme ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, this image
> reveals the Sun’s upper atmosphere, the corona, which has a temperature of
> around a million degrees Celsius.  In total, the final image contains more
> than 83 million pixels in a 9148 x 9112 pixel grid, making it the highest
> resolution image of the Sun’s full disc and outer atmosphere, the corona,
> ever taken.
