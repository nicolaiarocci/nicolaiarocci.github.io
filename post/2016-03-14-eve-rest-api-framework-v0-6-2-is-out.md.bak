Today I released [Eve][1] 0.6.2. It includes many fixes and improvements over the previous releases. Areas addressed are CORS management, soft deletes, token authentication, oplog, data validation, and others. Please see the [changelog][2] for details.

Work on v0.7 is also ongoing. It will include new features such as support for the MongoDB Aggregation Framework ([docs][3]) and a few breaking changes, so you might want to check it out in advance.

Special thanks to Arnau Orriols, Cyril Bonnard, Hamdy, Luca Di Gaspero, Manquer, Nick Park, Patrick Decat, Prayag Verma, Ralph Smith, Stratos Gerakakis, Valerie Coffman and Wei Guan who contributed to this release.
