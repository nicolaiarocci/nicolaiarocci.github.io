Today I was interviewed by [Mauro Servienti][2] on the [DotNetPodcast][1]. The
theme was my experience as an open-source maintainer on both the Python and C#
stacks. We also discussed the ongoing evolution of the dotNET ecosystem,
touching on a few tangent topics. 

The recording is in Italian and is available below here.
