I am an application/backend developer who has to quibble with databases more
often than desired. I can get my way around Postgres pretty well, but I can
always use a hint or two, especially when it comes to fine-tuning and
performance. 

I stumbled upon [Cleaning Up Your Postgres Databases][1]. It offers useful
advice on spotting performance bottlenecks in your Postgres database. Take the
cache and index hit queries, for example. 

> The first thing you're going to want to look at is your cache hit ratio and
> index hit ratio. Your cache hit ratio is going to give the percentage of time
> your data is served from within memory vs. having to go to disk. Generally
> serving data from memory vs. disk is going to orders of magnitude faster,
> thus the more you can serve from memory the better. For a typical web
> application making a lot of short requests I'm going to target > 99% here. 

I will be trying them real soon. Like, today.
