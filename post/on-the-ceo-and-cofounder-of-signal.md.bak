Last weekend's reading list also included [Taking Back Our Privacy][1], yet
another[^2] New Yorker piece but this time signed by Anna Wiener. This article is
a long-read on Moxie Marlinspike, co-founder and CEO of Signal. Moxie is
a childhood nickname. That alone signals (pun intended) an original
personality. I mean, how many times have you heard of a CEO going by his
childhood nickname?

Indeed the personal story of Marlinspike, along with that of the ascent of
Signal, is fascinating. I did not know, for example, that in 2013 he met Brian
Acton, founder of WhatsApp. Brian expressed interest in adding end-to-end
encryption into WhatsApp. Then came Facebook's acquisition, and, for obvious
reasons, Signal Protocol never landed into the messaging service. The story was
not over, however:

> That year, Acton left Facebook, later attributing his departure to
> intractable differences about privacy practices. At the heart of the conflict
> was tension with Facebook’s top executives, Sheryl Sandberg and Mark
> Zuckerberg, who wanted to extend Facebook’s targeted-ad network to WhatsApp.
> End-to-end encryption precluded the collection of message content that would
> be valuable to advertisers. In early 2018, Acton and Marlinspike announced
> the formation of the Signal Foundation, a nonprofit. Acton, the foundation’s
> chairman and sole member, seeded it with a no-interest, fifty-million-dollar
> loan.

What a plot twist. What's even more remarkable is Moxie's personal biography.
He is not your average startup co-founder, not by any mean. He kind stands at
the interconnection between activism, ethical hacking, and anarchy, and yet
he's the CEO of a booming startup.
