I'm just back from reading [Programmer Interrupted: The Real Cost of Interruption and Context Switching][1], an interesting
short piece in which I learned about at least two new things.

First, *The Parable of the Two Watchmakers*, introduced by Nobel Prize winner Herbert Simon, describes the complex
relationship between sub-systems and their larger wholes. In the context of the article, it helps explain, even for
non-programmers, the cost of an interruption. It also hints at a possible mitigation technique:

> There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang
> frequently and new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and
> poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

> The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to
> put down a partly assembled watch, it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.
> Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together sub-assemblies of about ten components each, and each
> sub-assembly could be put down without falling apart. Ten of these sub-assemblies could be put together to make a
> larger sub-assembly, and ten of the larger sub-assemblies constituted the whole watch.

Second, larger computer screens help a programmer keep his mental model (and context) together. I'm still deciding on
this one. Focusing on a single window or not having a lot of cruft around the screen helps solve complex code for me.
But toss anything John Carmack at me, and I will abide.

> The 640 x 480 resolution was the standard from 1990 to around 1996, but it was possible to get more screen real estate
> back then. There is a famous photo of John Carmack working on Quake using a 28-inch 1080p monitor in 1995.

> Why did he choose 45 kg monitor for about $10k in 1995? The higher screen real estate allowed for more code to be
> visible at once, resulting in a more dense context. Productivity greatly increases when you have the ability to store
> and access more detailed context. It's like having a larger desk to hold documents when studying for an exam or doing
> any task that requires the use of multiple sources of information from a common domain, such as solving puzzles.

The brilliant comic that opens the article is the perfect TL;DR for the Watchmakers parable.
