One of my recent discoveries is [A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry][1] by
Bret Devereaux, an historian who's been posting great content over the years.
His Fireside Fridays, for example, provide intriguing musings on varied topics.
In this week instalment, professor Devereaux takes on the different
applications of blockchain technology as seen from a historian's perspective.

> Because while I can offer no real opinion as to if any of these new
> technologies will succeed in their technical objectives [...], proponents of
> these technologies typically envisage them eventually producing large social
> effects, in particular they imagine that blockchain technology will create an
> economic and social space outside of the control of the state, traditional
> banking institutions or society at large. And here is a space where
> a historianâ€™s expertise is valuable and also almost completely lacking among
> blockchain enthusiasts.
