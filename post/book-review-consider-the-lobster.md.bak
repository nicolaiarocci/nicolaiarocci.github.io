I found a Consider the Lobster [review][1] on Goodreads that almost precisely
matches my thoughts on DFW and the book. Hence, given the lazy Christmas-break
mood I am in right now, I am conceding myself the right to copy-paste and edit
David's review right away.

I know of nobody else who writes as thoughtfully and intelligently as DFW. That
he manages to write so informatively, with humor and genuine wit, on almost any
subject under the sun is mind-blowing â€“ it's also why I am willing to forgive
his occasional stylistic excesses. (Can you spell 'footnote'?) You may not have
a strong interest in lobsters or pornography, but the essays in question are
terrific. The reporting on Ziegler and McCain is outstanding, heartbreakingly
so, because it makes the relative shallowness of most reporting painfully
evident.

Yes, I know all about his weaknesses - the digressions, the rampant footnote
abuse, the flaunting of his extraordinary erudition. I know all this, and
I don't care. Because when he is in top form, there's nobody else I would
instead read. The man is hilarious; I think he's a mensch, and I don't believe
he parades his erudition to prove how smart he is. I think he can't help
himself - it's a consequence of his wide-ranging curiosity. At heart, he's
a geek but a charming, hyper-articulate geek. Who is almost frighteningly
bright.

If you have never read DFW, my advice would be to start with his non-fiction,
which is way more accessible than his fiction (with the notable exception of
The Brook of the System, which was my first adored DFW reading.)
