My perception of zoos has always been of prisonsâ€”places of suffering where
animals are held captive for human entertainment. *Smiling Bears* offered a new
perspective. Some (hopefully most) zoos provide a safe harbor to abused and
rescued animals who could never return to their natural habitats. Zookeepers
like Else Poulsen care for these creatures, accompanying them in their
rehabilitation process. I imagine not all zoos and zookeepers meet these
standards, but it is reassuring to know these things happen.

Few people know bears as intimately as Else Poulsen. She has raised bears,
comforted bears, taught bears, learned from bears, had bears communicate their
needs to her, and nursed bears back to health. This book offers remarkable
insights into the complexity and richness of bears behavior and emotional life.
Individual bear stories are often touching, as is the relationship they develop
with their care keeper.
