Quoting [Nelson's weblog][3]:

Ouch. A lesson learned the hard way:

One of the many reasons I don't write my reviews on Goodreads and host them on
my website instead is precisely the risk of losing them all one day[^1]. The same
with Twitter. I have been on Twitter since 2009 and was very active there.
I [witnessed][6] the BBS era. Since then, I've seen oh-so-many "too big to fail"
services coming and going, I could fill a book.

Tweeting is quicker and faster, yes. So is writing a review on Goodreads. If
I don't feel like opening vim to write something, though, then it's probably
not worth sharing in the first place. 

Posting on Goodreads or Twitter grants more visibility, that's for sure.
I understand that clicking a link to leave the platform is an effort that not
everyone is willing to make. I'm probably losing followers on Twitter and
'friends' on Goodreads. That's fine[^5]. Those remaining are likely to be more
interested in my content and, ultimately, in me as a person. 

Most of the stuff I write here is meant for myself anyway. If what I write
happens to also be interesting for other readers, that's cool, but it's not the
primary goal. I feel much better now that I own my content. The switch from
social media content production to [POSSE][4] was beneficial and is something
I advise everyone to do.

 [^1]: Other compelling reasons are not being okay with platforms profiling me or profiting from my content.
 [^5]: Besides, I wish more and more people would fall back to RSS for their content consumption. That's how I discover and collect content. Weblogs, YouTube channels, news and science sites, programming resources, and even top Twitter profiles all get digested by my RSS reader.
