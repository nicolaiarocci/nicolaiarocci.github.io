I&#8217;m just back from the <a title="MongoDB Masters" href="http://www.mongodb.org/about/community/masters/" target="_blank">MongoDB Masters</a> Summit hosted by 10Gen in New York City. In just a couple days I was given the opportunity to meet and share knowledge (and fun!) with amazingly talented minds coming from all over the world. I&#8217;m back with literally dozen new ideas opportunities and concepts, on which I&#8217;ll need to elaborate a little bit. While I cannot comment on the many things the smart minds at 10Gen are working on, rest assured that the future of MongoDB is looking great and brighter than ever.
