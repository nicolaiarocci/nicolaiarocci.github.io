> On New Years Day of 2022, I stumbled out of bed and immediately lost my
> vision, fell to the floor, and had to get my then-partner to help me back
> into bed. This wasn’t the first time this had happened, and I knew what it
> was straight away - I was having a migraine. In the previous decade I’d had
> countless migraines, and they always followed the same pattern. I’d wake up
> after a night out, attempt to get to the bathroom, lose my vision, and most
> likely end up on the floor vomiting from the pain that I can only describe as
> feeling like someone trying to hammer a nail into my skull. 
> The worst part about them? They were avoidable.
