Last week, thanks to [Andrea Verlicchi][1][^7]'s effort, we ran the first
in-person [DevRomagna][2] event since 2019. We did some meetups during the
pandemic, some in 2020 and a couple in 2022, but they were all online.

In theory, online meetups and DevRomagna are a match made in heaven. The
[Romagna region][3] consists of small same-size towns scattered in the vast
countryside. To accommodate this, and in an attempt to encourage varied
participation, DevRomagna has always been a roaming meetup. We might be in one
place one month, and then, next month, we will likely move to another town.
With online meetups, attendance doesn't have to commit to a commute saving
time and money and allowing everyone to participate in events that would
otherwise be too far away. 

But there's value in commitment. The other day, we gathered in a new cozy
venue ([Ca' Vaina][4][^6], a municipality-run youth center and coworking space)
where my friend [Gabriele Santomaggio][5] talked about Kubernetes, service mesh
and isolation techniques he and his colleagues adopt at Vmware. After the talk,
some of us went for dinner in a nearby pizzeria. The pizza was good, and the
craft beer was great. We talked about many things like our jobs, our favorite
developer tools and languages, and all the nerdy stuff you'd imagine.
Suggestions for new original presentations were thrown around, which is always
good. Most importantly, I got to know new people, including Ugo, a fellow
[Microsoft MVP][8] from my area whom I somehow managed not to meet in all these
years. With Ugo, we are now planning a few hopefully engaging dotnet-centered
events. 

All in all, it was a pleasant, fruitful evening spent with like-minded
individuals. We could have done an online event with, probably, a higher
attendance. I would've saved some money and time (Imola, the town where the
meetup took place, is a half-hour drive, which includes a highway toll), but
I wouldn't get to meet Ugo at the table or see Gabriele after two years of
pandemic-inflicted hiatus. 

More than one interested in the event asked if we would stream it, and my
answer was no for several reasons. I suspect that in-person attendance would
dwindle if we'd stream our events, as we'd be effectively discouraging active
participation. Also, it wouldn't be fair to the people who make an effort and
come to the venue. Recording the session and streaming them later might be an
option, but this would discourage live participation too. So, for the time
being, whenever possible, DevRomagna will stay true to its roots and remain
a live event. There might be exceptions, like if we have a foreign or far-away
guest or can't find a proper venue. 

We're a local meetup, and "local" hardly conjugates with "online."
