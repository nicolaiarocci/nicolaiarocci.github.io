Jacob Kaplan-Moss's hot take on software quality:

> **Software quality is more the result of a system designed to produce
> quality, and not so much the result of individual performance**. That is:
> a group of mediocre programmers working with a structure designed to produce
> quality will produce better software than a group of fantastic programmers
> working in a system designed with other goals.

This leads to the insightful conclusion:

> Instead of spending tons of time and effort on hiring because you believe
> that you can “only hire the best”, direct some of that effort towards
> building a system that produces great results out of a wider spectrum of
> individual performance.

But what does he mean by a *system designed for quality*? Read it all [here][1].
