Today's mandatory reading is [How I cut GTA Online loading times by 70%][1].

As someone who's been fighting the protection/obfuscation cat & mouse game for
twenty+ years, let me tell you one thing. The way this guy reverse-engineered
parts of the GTA5 codebase and then proceeded to single-handly triage and fix
a long-standing (7+ years) performance issue is simply mindblowing. All he had
to work with were heavily obfuscated dlls.  This also shows how we, the
protectors, are always playing a losing game.

> The instructions have to be de-obfuscated before running one way or another.

Make sure you read this [stuff][1].
