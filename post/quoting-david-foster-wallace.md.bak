> Because here’s something else that’s true. In the day-to-day trenches of
> adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such
> thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what
> to worship. And an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of God or
> spiritual-type thing to worship-be it J.C. or Allah, be it Yahweh or the
> Wiccan mother-goddess or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set of
> ethical principles-is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you
> alive. If you worship money and things-if they are where you tap real meaning
> in life-then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It’s the
> truth.

> Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel
> ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths
> before they finally plant you. On one level, we all know this stuff
> already-it’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, bromides, epigrams,
> parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth
> up-front in daily consciousness. Worship power-you will feel weak and afraid,
> and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay.
> Worship your intellect, being seen as smart-you will end up feeling stupid,
> a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on.
