> In 1701, in Middletown, New Jersey, Moses Butterworth languished in a jail,
> accused of piracy. Like many young men based in England or her colonies, he
> had joined a crew that sailed the Indian Ocean intent on plundering ships of
> the Muslim Mughal Empire. Throughout the 1690s, these pirates marauded
> vessels laden with gold, jewels, silk, and calico on pilgrimage toward Mecca.
> After achieving great success, many of these men sailed back into the
> Atlantic via Madagascar to the North American seaboard, where they quietly
> disembarked in Charleston, Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York City, Newport,
> and Boston, and made themselves at home.
