Today, the New York Times&#8217; SundayReview features a great column by Matthew B. Crawford: [The Cost of Paying Attention][1].

> Attention is a resource; a person has only so much of it [&#8230;] What if we saw attention in the same way that we saw air or water, as a valuable resource that we hold in common? Perhaps, if we could envision an “attentional commons,” then we could figure out how to protect it.
