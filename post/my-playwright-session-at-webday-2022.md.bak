If you understand Italian, the recording of my Playwright session at
UGIdotNET's [WebDay 2022][1] is now available on YouTube[^2]. Playwright is
a phenomenal cross-browser, cross-platform, cross-language, single-API,
mobile-friendly front-end testing tool. 

I'm looking forward to giving the same session in English sooner or later, but
I should first win my laziness and start looking for exciting events with open
CFPs. If you happen to know one, please let me know.
