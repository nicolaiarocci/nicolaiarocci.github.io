What a fascinating read. It sits right at the intersection of two of my (too
many) vicious interests: Jazz music and books.

> Since the mid-1970s, almost every jazz musician has owned a copy of the same
> book. It has a peach-colored cover, a chunky, 1970s-style logo, and a black
> plastic binding. It’s delightfully homemade-looking—like it was printed by
> a bunch of teenagers at a Kinkos. And inside is the sheet music for hundreds
> of common jazz tunes—also known as jazz “standards”—all meticulously notated
> by hand. It’s called the Real Book.

> But if you were going to music school in the 1970s, you couldn’t just buy
> a copy of the Real Book at the campus bookstore. Because the Real Book… was
> illegal. The world’s most popular collection of Jazz music was a totally
> unlicensed publication. It was a self-published book created without
> permission from music publishers or songwriters. It was duplicated at
> photocopy shops and sold on street corners, out of the trunks of cars, and
> under the table at music stores where people used secret code words to make
> the exchange. The full story of how the Real Book came to be this bootleg
> bible of jazz is a complicated one. It’s a story about what happens when an
> insurgent, improvisational art form like Jazz gets codified and becomes
> something that you can learn from a book. 

The whole story, both as text or podcast, is available [here][1].
