A very interesting read if you&#8217;re into Python. Eve has been Python 3 compatible for a while and honestl, I would be surprised to find that somebody is running it in production under Python 3.

In retrospect this was a mistake, it resulted in a complete lack of urgency for the community to move, and the lack of urgency has given way to lethargy.

It doesn&#8217;t have the super big ticket items people want, such as removal of the GIL or better performance (for which many are using PyPy). Instead it has many new libraries (whose need is largely filled by pip install), and small cleanups which many experienced Python developers just avoid by habit at this point. Certainly nothing that would make one stop their development for any length of time to upgrade, not when Python 2 seems like it&#8217;s going to be here for a while.
