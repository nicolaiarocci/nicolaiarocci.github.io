After five years in Oracle's MySQL team, Steinar H. Gunderson resigned a few
days ago. On the same day, he dropped the bomb on his [blog][1]:

>  let me point out something that I've been saying both internally and
>  externally for the last five years (although never on a stageâ€”which explains
>  why I've been staying away from stages talking about MySQL): **MySQL is

As [@brandur][3] appropriately puts it, in the world of software engineering,
it rarely gets more definitive than that. And authoritative, I might add, given
both the role he covered at Oracle and his overall [track record][5]. The whole
short post is worth reading[^4].
