Seven years since the first commit, I am glad to announce that Eve v1.0 has been released. [Check it out on PyPI.][pypi]

If you are using Eve, Cerberus, FatturaElettronica for .NET or any other one of my open source projects in a revenue-generating product, it would make business sense to sponsor my open source development. Learn how to do that at [my GitHub Sponsors page][ghs].
