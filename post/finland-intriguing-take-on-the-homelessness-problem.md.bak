Finland's [take on the homelessness problem][1] is remarkable and gives hope.
I live in a small town where the problem is not as apparent as in, say, San
Francisco. Whenever I think back to my short time in San Francisco, I shudder
at the terrifying homelessness situation I met there. There, in San Francisco,
I realized the magnitude of "true liberalism"'s failure.
