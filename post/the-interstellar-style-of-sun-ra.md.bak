Pitchfork has a great piece on Sun Ra and his legacy. It's worth reading if you're a fan, even more so if you know
nothing about him.

>  But what Sun Ra had done, and done best, was reminding earthlings everywhere that he wasn’t mortal. He was a
>  signifier of a life beyond the reality of this one. He was a visual reassurance of the presence of another world. He
>  brought the cosmos to the streets, and, most importantly, he was a reminder that one does not have to subscribe to
>  the status quo—musically, stylistically, politically, ideologically.
