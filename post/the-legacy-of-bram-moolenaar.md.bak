Quoting [Jan van den Berg](https://j11g.com/2023/08/07/the-legacy-of-bram-moolenaar/):

> This weekend we learned that Bram Moolenaar had passed away at the age of 62. And this news affected me more than I
> expected. Like so many: I did not know Bram personally. But I’ve been using a tool made by Bram for more than half my
> life — at least weekly, sometimes daily. That tool is a text editor. The best one there is: Vim.
