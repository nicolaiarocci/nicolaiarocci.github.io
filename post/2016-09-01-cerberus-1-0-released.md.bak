After a one year long development cycle I am proud to announce that version 1.0 of [Cerberus][1], the data validation and transformation tool for Python, is finally out. A while ago I wrote an article on the [new features and breaking changes][2] that come with it, so please check it out carefully along with the [changelog][3].

I just wish to reiterate my gratitude towards all the contributors to the project. The ones who specifically worked on this awesome release, those who made it all possible, are: Matthew Ellison, Dominik Kellner, David Kirkendall, Dami√°n Nohales, calve, Jonathan Huot, Roman Redkovich and of course the one and the only Frank Sachsenheim, whose role was pivotal to this release.

If you want to get in touch, I am [@nicolaiarocci][4] on Twitter.
