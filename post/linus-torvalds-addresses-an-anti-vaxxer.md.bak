Linus Torvalds' [reply to an anti-vaxxer][1] on the Linux kernel list is
a must-read. Pre-2018, Linus would have destroyed the poor chump. He's
discouraging further discussion (Kernel list is not the place for that) while
providing crystal clear and detailed mRNA vaccine information, all without
renouncing to an opening salvo of his good-ole, grumpy style.

As John Gruber [affirms][2], this is one rant we can all get behind.
