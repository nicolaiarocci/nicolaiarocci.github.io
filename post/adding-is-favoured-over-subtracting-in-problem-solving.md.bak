title: "Adding is favoured over subtracting in problem solving (and software systems)"

Consider the 10x10 grids of green and white boxes below. How would you
make them symmetrical? Most people would add green boxes to the emptier half of
the grid rather than remove them from the fuller half. *Even when the latter
would have been more efficient*.

The case, along with a similar problem revolving around the stability of
a peculiar lego structure, is reported by an [intriguing Nature article][1] on
the topic of psychology and human behaviour. The paper linked to the piece
demonstrates that people consistently consider changes that add components over
those that subtract them.

Is the innate tendency to favour additive solutions contributing to the entropy
of the software systems we build? And if so, isn't over-engineering, the
scarecrow of software systems,  its most apparent consequence? I'm in no way an
expert in human behaviour and its implications in software engineering. Still,
my bet is on a hard yes on both questions.
