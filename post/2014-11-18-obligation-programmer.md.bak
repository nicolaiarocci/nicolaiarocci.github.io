Robert C.Martin, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" target="_blank">Clean Code</a> fame, has something to say on the role of we programmers in today&#8217;s society.

> We rule the world.
> 
> We don&#8217;t quite understand this yet. More importantly, the world doesn&#8217;t quite understand it yet. Our civilization doesn&#8217;t quite realize how dependent it has become on software &#8212; on us.

He goes as far as suggesting a programmer&#8217;s code of conduct of sorts. Food for thought I guess, although I suspect we&#8217;re too much of a wild and scattered bunch for something like that to really stick.

Nonetheless, he raises a very good point about the predominance of software in our society and the risk that soon or later someone will wake up and attempt to impose some sort of regulation on the profession.
