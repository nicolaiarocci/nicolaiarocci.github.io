[Bret Devereaux][1] has long been my go-to source for all things ancient and
military history. One thing I somehow missed reading from his incredibly
resourceful website is the [This Isn't Sparta][2] series. He recently published
a three-year-anniversary series retrospective which promptly surfaced on my
RSS feed, giving me a chance to catch up over the holidays. The whole thing is
a very long read, with some installments more engaging than others but overall
very enjoyable, eye-opening, and information dense. In the just-published
retrospective, Bret writes:

As a former 100% Sparta Bro, I qualified for the target audience. Paraphrasing
Marx, one could say that ignorance is the opium of the people. Take 300 the
movie.  I'm glad I saw it as entirely ignorant of Sparta's 'real' prowess, or
most fun would have been spoiled.
