Years ago, I [translated][2] an essay by Terry Windling, [On Tolkien and
Fairie-Stories][1], from American English to Italian. I remember arguing with
the author about her use of periods in quotations. Each quotation would end
with a period before the closing mark. I was puzzled. We don't do that in
Italy. More importantly, I read many English texts where the period was left
outside the quotation itself. She insisted that her style was correct[^4].

Today I learn that, in English, there are in fact two different and conflicting
quotation mark punctuation styles: American and British.

> There are different ways of combining quotation and punctuation marks. In the
> American style, you almost always put periods and commas inside the quotation
> marks [...] In the British style, however, you put periods and commas outside
> the quotation marks, unless they are part of a complete sentence that is
> fully contained between the quotation marks:

In [The American Style of Quotation Mark Punctuation Makes No Sense][3] the
author illustrates the differences between the two styles, then argues that
"the British approach makes more sense, so use that one." Whoops.
