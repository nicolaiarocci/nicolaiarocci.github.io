Brian Rinaldi has an insightful post on [his blog][1] about the current state of
developer conferences, where 'current state' means post-COVID pandemic. Brian
is well-positioned to reason about this space as a long-time conference
organizer. I appreciate that he also takes the time to explain how the
developer conference business works. The core of his blog is about
post-pandemic conference attendance, which has plunged.

And he offers an interesting theory on why that is:

As a conference speaker and meetup organizer, I noticed that online events saw
low attendance during the pandemic, and they still do today. When available,
recordings partially compensate, but only in audience terms. The problem is
online events are not conferences. 'Conference' originates from the late Latin
"conferentia," itself a derivative of "conferre," a synonym for the collation
of "bring together"[^4]. A conference is a meeting to discuss some topics. The
get-together element is missing in online events, and networking is next to
impossible (live chats and 'virtual after-parties' are just poor palliatives.)
In my book, hybrid events are even worse, as live streaming and recordings
discourage live attendance (at the [DevRomagna meetups][2], we often get asked
if live streaming or recordings will be available, and the answer is no -
either we do live streaming - and we sometimes do - or we do an in-person
event, but never a mix of the two.)

Going back to Brian's musings, I think I subscribe to them. I am not sure
attendance will ever get back to old numbers. I am afraid a good portion of
those who were regulars became disaffected, and gaining their attention back is
a hard gamble. YouTube and Twitch, I think, are phenomenal competitors, and the
pandemic hiatus threw a ton of fresh new viewers at them.

PS: Coincidentally, we're running an in-person meetup at DevRomagna [today][3].
