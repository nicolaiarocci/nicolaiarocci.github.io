title: New website, finally with no analytics
tags: ["website", "hugo", "analytics"]

During the Christmas/New Year break, I achieved my goal of updating my website
with a new theme. I loved
[Casper](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper), the previous one I ran
for a very long time, but it has not been updated in years and looks abandoned.
I wanted new features like [fuzzy search](/search/), [archive](/archives/) and
[tags](/tags/) pages, [cover images](/the-wilderness-of-poggio-montironi/),
[table of contents](/books-i-have-read/), title anchors, and more. Also, the
old theme kept me anchored to an ancient Hugo version, something I felt
uncomfortable with. There are still a few loose parts, but I'm confident I made
the right call by switching to [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod); it offers all the
needed features (and plenty more), and it's frequently updated, which allows me
to [open tickets](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/issues/1367)
and offer improvements confidently.

I also dropped web analytics. I've not counted visits or any other metric for
years; I realized I'm not interested and certainly don't need metrics for
motivation. I happen to hate Google Analytics UX so much that I always wanted to
replace it, but never got around to doing that. Besides, from my small
experiments, web metrics are unreliable. Just today, Manuel Moreale's [little
analytics experiment](https://manuelmoreale.com/answers-to-my-analytics-inquiry)
surfaced on my RSS reader:

>[...] we were discussing the discrepancy between log numbers and the ones
coming out of the various analytics platforms and were noticing how they all
spit out different data. Which to me makes no sense. Still, it's an interesting
topic and I decided to run a little experiment to gather more info on the
subject.

His article is worth reading. He ran four different GA-alternative analytics
platforms on his website for a short period and obtained unpredictable and
differentiated results. His conclusions corroborate my impression: trust web
analytics sparingly, if at all.  They might make sense on professional websites
(and I'd like to argue against that, too, but maybe in another post), but for
blogs? They do not serve any useful purpose other than slowing down the whole
thing.
