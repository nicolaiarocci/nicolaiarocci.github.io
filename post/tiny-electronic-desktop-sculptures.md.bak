Adorable, functional, often internet-connected desktop bots like those below are hand-crafted by Mohit Bhoite in San
Francisco, California.

It pleasantly surprised me that they're built as a purely artistic expression. All sculptures (as Mohit rightfully refers
to them) are unique and not for sale. Check them all out on [his website][1] *([via][2])*.
