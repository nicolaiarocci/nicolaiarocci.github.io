Simon Wilson, who's recently been my go-to person for all AI-related stuff, has
an excellent [2023 AI
round-up](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/31/ai-in-2023/) on his website. 

> 2023 was the breakthrough year for Large Language Models (LLMs). I think it's
OK to call these AIâ€”they're the latest and (currently) most "interesting
development in the academic field of Artificial Intelligence that dates back to
the 1950s. Here's my attempt to round up the highlights in one place!

The links contained within the post are also valuable. You may know Simon's
website if you are interested in LLMs and AI. If you don't, I suggest you start
following him, preferably via his RSS feed like real hackers do.
