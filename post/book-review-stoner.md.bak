I tend to shy away from publishing cases, so *Stoner* has been resting on my
yeah-maybe-one-day list for years. Over time I stumbled on notable mentions
that kept the book on the fringe of my attention zone. Then one day, I read a
brief and intriguing [review][2] in Giovanni Zagni's excellent newsletter,
*Incertezze*. Like me, Zagni suffers from the stay-away-from-editorial-cases
idiosyncrasy, but he finally gave in, read the thing, reread it, and finally
tagged it a modern classic. Zagni was convincing, yet it took another year
before I surrendered my weapons and took the book off the shelf. I immediately
realized I was in front of a beautiful book. 

The *New York Review of Books* has this to say about the novel: 

> John Williams's luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet
> perfection. William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American
> but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by
> Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world.

I find this description perfectly fit. Like Hopper's paintings, John William's
prose is indeed sparse, detached and powerful. 

The protagonist is a professor of English at the University of Missouri in the
first half of the twentieth century. From the outside, his life and attitude
appear ordinary and dull, and that's how most former students and colleagues
may remember him. And yet, as his life unfolds in the pages, from boyhood at
the dirt-poor family farm to college and then adulthood,  the reader soon
recognizes the William Stoner as a modern hero, incredibly resilient in the
face of continued and unremitting harassment from the people and events around
him.

The author John Williams grew up on a small farm in Texas and had a similar
escape to the University as Stoner's. Not coincidentally, I think, the author
and protagonist share resembling names. While not an autobiography, the novel
is probably imbued with the author's experiences. 

Going back to Zagni's review, his opinion is the this novel was ahead of its
time, which would explain why it wasn't an immediate hit. Indeed,I was struck
by the precise and painful description of some characters' struggles with
mental issues and past abuses and how these can unintentionally affect family
dynamics and persist over generations. 

Stoner is a deceptively simple novel written in 1965 that tells facts of the
early twentieth century, yet it has much to say to the people of the modern
age.[^3]
