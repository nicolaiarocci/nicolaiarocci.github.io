I stumbled upon a personal growth article this weekend, and that's odd because
I tend to stay clear from such things. Yet I found it quite relevant, so much
that I thought I would [share it][1] (the delivery is also amusing, which is
something new for this kind of content).

While I agree with the article, I'd also mention that travel or putting some
distance from the Box of Daily Experience, as the author calls it, is a great
way to appreciate what we leave behind; to re-evaluate it from a different
perspective.

As I read the article, I kept thinking, this is not particularly original;
I read something like this before. Then, by the end of the piece, a note tells
us that the text is, in fact, an adaptation of Seneca's letter to Lucilius on
the subject of travel. Seneca's moral letters to Lucilius are just pure
awesomeness.
