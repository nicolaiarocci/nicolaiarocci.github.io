Wendy Molyneux, [writing unabashedly][1] for McSweeney's, summarizes all I have
to say on the COVID vaccine and never dared to say:

> You think vaccines don’t fucking work? Oh, fuck off into the trash, you
> attention-seeking fuckworm-faced shitbutt. This isn’t even a point worth
> discussing, you fuck-o-rama fuck-stival of ignorance. Vaccines got rid of
> smallpox and polio and all the other disgusting diseases that used to kill
> off little fucks like you en masse. Your relatives got fucking vaccinated and
> let you live, and now here you are signing up to be killed by a fucking
> disease against which there is a ninety-nine-percent effective vaccine. You
> fucking moron. Go in the fucking ocean and fuck a piranha. Fuck. Fuck that.
> Fuck you. Get vaccinated.
