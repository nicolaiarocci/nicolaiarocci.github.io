I went back to my library to check the year of my original *Neuromancer* edition.
It's 1993. For some context, I was 23 back then, with my software company
founded only a couple of years earlier. The World Wide Web was at its very
early stages. I distinctly remember getting out of that book dazed and
confused. Characters were two-dimensional at best. There was a certain lack of
exposition. The recurring streams of consciousness were complex for me to
follow[^3]. I knew I had something powerful and innovative in my hands; I was
fascinated, but Gibson's writing, I think, put me off[^2].

These musings were recently conjured by reading *[Neuromancer. The Birth of
Cyberpunk][1]*, a fine, splendidly illustrated short essay on Gibson's
influence, published by Sabukaru Online (which feed I promptly added to my RSS
reader.).

> When Gibson penned his opening line ‘the sky above the port was the colour of
> television, tuned to a dead channel’ he merged reality and the digital in
> a way that seems almost prophetic today, as online footprints grow
> exponentially and internet universes creep into reality. Instead of two
> separate realms, there’s a ripple and blur. 

I might re-read the novel. I'm curious about my opinion as a senior reader.

 [^2]: At the time, I didn't know that *Neuromancer* was Gibson's first novel.
