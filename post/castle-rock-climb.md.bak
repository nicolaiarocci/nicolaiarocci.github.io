There's regular hiking, and then there's Antarctica hiking. Check out [brr's
report of a Sunday's hike][1] from McMurdo's base up to the tip of Castle
Rock, with spectacular views of Mount Erebus and the surroundings.

brr's Antarticta blog is a recent addition to my RSS feed collection. It's
always interesting to follow people living and working in the most remote parts
of the world.
