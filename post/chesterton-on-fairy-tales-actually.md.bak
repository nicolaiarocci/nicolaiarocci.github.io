[Robin Rendle][1] quoting Neil Gaiman, who is quoting G.K. Chesterton:

> Fairy tales, as G.K. Chesterton once said, are more than true. Not because
> they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be
> defeated.

I read [somewhere][2] that he based the Gilbert character from *The Sandman*
on Chesterton, so it's no surprise to find Gaiman quoting Chesterton in *Smoke
and Mirrors*.

Wanting to find the work in which the quote first appeared, I did
a little research only to discover that G.K. Chesterton never actually wrote
it. According to [E.M. Goldsmith][3][^4], Gaiman's is a rework of the following
original quote:

> Fairy Tales then, are not responsible for producing in children fear, or any
> of the shapes of fear; fairy tales do not give the child the idea of the evil
> or the ugly; that is in the child already, because it is in the world
> already. **Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What
> fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of
> bogey**. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an
> imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the
> dragon. Exactly what the fairy tale does is this: it accustoms him to
> a series of clear pictures of **the idea that these limitless terrors had
> a limit, that these shapeless enemies have enemies in the knights of God,
> that there is something in the universe more mystical than darkness, and
> stronger than strong fear.** --Tremendous Trifles (1909), XVII: "The Red
> Angel"[^6]

An excellently simplified, actualized and de-Christianized rework, I'd say.  On
the subject of fairy tales, E.M. Goldsmith has another quote that is worth
sharing:

> When we step into the family, by the act of being born, we do step into
> a world which is incalculable, into a world which has its own strange laws,
> into a world which could do without us, into a world we have not made. In
> other words, when we step into the family we step into a fairy-tale."
> â€“Heretics, CW, I, p.143 G.K. Chesterton.

What great of a writer Chesterton was. No wonder Jorge Luis Borges and J.R.R.
Tolkien were some of his great estimators. On Chesterton, Borges supposedly[^5]
said: "Literature is one of the forms of happiness; perhaps no writer has given
me as many happy hours as Chesterton."
