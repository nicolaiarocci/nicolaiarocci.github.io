Chris Moran, the Guardian’s head of editorial innovation:

> Last month one of our journalists received an interesting email. A researcher had come across mention of a Guardian
> article, written by the journalist on a specific subject from a few years before. But the piece was proving elusive on
> our website and in search. Had the headline perhaps been changed since it was launched? Had it been removed
> intentionally from the website because of a problem we’d identified? Or had we been forced to take it down by the
> subject of the piece through legal means?

> The reporter couldn’t remember writing the specific piece, but the headline certainly sounded like something they
> would have written. It was a subject they were identified with and had a record of covering. Worried that there may
> have been some mistake at our end, they asked colleagues to go back through our systems to track it down. Despite the
> detailed records we keep of all our content, and especially around deletions or legal issues, they could find no trace
> of its existence.

> Why? Because it had never been written.
