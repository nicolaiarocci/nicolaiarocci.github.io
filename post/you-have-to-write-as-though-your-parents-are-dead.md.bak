The Literary Hub has a great short [interview][1] with Ian McEwan.

> **What’s the best writing advice you’ve ever received?**
> When I was living in London at the start of my career in the mid-1970s,
> I became friends with Philip Roth, who took an avuncular interest in my work.
> Where many others thought my writing was wild and weird, he thought I wasn’t
> being wild enough. He once came to my apartment and spread the typescript of
> my first novel (The Cement Garden) over the floor. He was on his hands and
> knees, moving the chapters around. What he wanted was for me to be bolder,
> crazier. He said, “You have to write as though your parents are dead.” My
> parents were alive. I took that advice. 

Great advice. How often do we restrain from writing, posting, or expressing our
thoughts because of our shyness? Or fear of being judged? Besides, I would take
any advice from someone who has this to say about Bach:

> **Which non-literary piece of culture—film, TV show, painting, song—could you
> not imagine your life without?** Since the age of 16, my constant resource has
> been the music of Bach. Piano first, then all the rest. Like all music, it is
> as abstract as literature is specific, but Bach’s inventions are more so—like
> the processes of thought before language, deeply human without saying
> anything at all. In his music I think I confront the most naked demonstration
> of genius. Wrapped inside the beauty is a form of merriness and a joyful
> pulse. The same pieces that thrilled me in my teens—the Goldberg Variations,
> the Well-tempered Clavier—thrill me now.

I loved how he saved the day by brilliantly answering the most boring writer
question of all times.

> **What time of day do you write?** The morning. My philosopher friend Galen
> Strawson divides humanity into those who feel they are living in a constantly
> unfolding narrative, a life story that informs our every moment, and those
> who existence is discontinuous. I now understand that I belong in this latter
> group, even while I’ve often persuaded myself I was in the first. [...] Now
> I can relax. I belong with those whose lives are lived in discrete patches.
> We can, of course, remember our childhoods, our first loves, our failures and
> joys when asked to, but almost all of our daily experience is disconnected
> from any awareness of the past. We also acknowledge that most of that past is
> lost to us forever. We, the non-narrativists, or episodists, wake in the
> mornings and we begin anew. I am my own blank sheet. As the day wears on,
> familiar concerns—domestic, professional, political, crowd in. The thing
> about that waiting desk is that you must turn up—and get there before the
> blank sheet that is you turns dog-eared.
