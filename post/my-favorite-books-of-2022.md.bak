I only read [17 books in 2022][5], confirming the slowdown of the last few
years. The total number of pages decreased too, albeit not too much compared to
the previous year. In 2021, though, there was a significant drop, as in 2020, I
read 28 books or 8073 pages. Stats have been going down since 2015, which is
interesting. Like [last year][4], I'm not sure why I'm reading less. More
tired? Less interested? I don't know.

This year I read more fiction than usual. I wouldn't say what I read was
uninteresting or dull; quite the contrary. Do the stats matter, though?
Probably not; I might be a bit obsessed with them. As long I enjoy what I read
and the time spent reading, I think I'm fine. 

Anyway, here's a selection of my favorite books for 2022. I picked three, but
they could easily be five (Italo Calvino's *Invisible Cities* and Nabokov'*s
Mašen'ka* made it to the shortlist.) In no particular order:

- *Memoirs of Hadrian*, by Marguerite Yourcenar. Terrific work of historical
  fiction. The memoirs are drafted by an elderly emperor Hadrian for his young
  friend "Mark," the future Marcus Aurelius. Hadrian does not flinch. He tells
  of his many great successes but does not hide his mistakes and weaknesses. He
  points out the former so that his protégé can steer clear of them; the latter
  he investigates, not without the indulgence that every elder is entitled to.
  My review is available [here][1].

- *Italica*, by Giacomo Papi. Italia is a remarkable collection of short
  stories from Italy's twentieth century, all written by prominent Italian
  writers of the period, including Italo Calvino, Elsa Morante, Beppe Fenoglio,
  Natalia Ginzburg, and Giorgio Scerbanenco. Enlightening short essays
  introduce each tale, helping contextualize the story. [Full review][2].

- *Stoner*, by John Williams. Quoting *the New York Review of Books*: John
  Williams's luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet perfection.
  William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American but as an
  unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward
  Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world. My review is [here][3].

Overall, I read great books in 2022. I'm now glancing at the dozen books
waiting for me on the shelf. I hope they'll provide me with the same level of
satisfaction, evasion, and entertainment as their predecessors.
