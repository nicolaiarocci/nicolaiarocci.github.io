I am pleased to announce that the latest version of Eve, v0.8, has been
released. As always, this release has been carefully crafted with love and
passion by yours truly, with the help of a fantastic bunch of contributors.

Highlights include data-validation-on-steroids thanks to the full support for
Cerberus 1.x, also recently released, partial media requests (think media
streaming), new hooks which allow you to attach custom callbacks to aggregation
and soft deletion events, some new query operators, support for the mongo
decimal type, and more. There are also many critical fixes and improvements.

Please note that v0.8 does not support Python 2.6 and 3.3 anymore. For the few
vintage developers left out there, I also released v0.7.9, which is the last
version with support for these legacy Python versions (no new features there,
though).

Before upgrading, make sure you check the breaking changes.
