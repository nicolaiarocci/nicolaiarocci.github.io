I dig Daniele Procida's take on [writing good software documentation][1]. It
just makes sense. The system is simple, comprehensive, and, crucial,
universally-applicable. The "four different functions" scheme works equally
well if you are writing for a technical-savvy audience or the general public,
which is excellent. The users I'm writing for are software developers, in some
cases, and desktop or web application users in others. 

I also like how he goes deep into explaining how and why each function has
a different goal, should be isolated and written differently from others.

Last but not least, the framework itself serves as a guide for the author. 

> This division makes it obvious to both author and reader what material, and

> **what to write**, and **where to write it**. It saves the author from

> documentation has only one job.

I wish I had this resource at hand when I was writing the docs for [my open
source projects][2]. I think will adopt this framework on the next occasion,
which will be very soon.
