In a few days, on Monday, December 4, at 10 a.m., I will present at the .NET Conference Italia 2023, which will be held
at the Microsoft House in Milan. My session is titled "C#12 What's new and interesting" and is part of a [rich agenda][1]
focused on the recent release of .NET 8.

I presented on the same subject at a [DevRomagna][2] meetup a few months ago when C# 12 was in preview and still had
several moving parts. Now that the final release is out, it will be interesting to return to the topic to consolidate my
knowledge. I suspect that of the many reasons I challenge myself to speak publicly, enriching my knowledge is prevalent.
As the adage goes, for learning a subject, nothing beats explaining it in front of a knowledgeable audience.

If you will attend the conference (you should!), remember to meet me and say hi!
