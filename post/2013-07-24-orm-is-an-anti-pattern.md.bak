In <a title="ORM is an anti-pattern" href="http://seldo.com/weblog/2011/08/11/orm_is_an_antipattern" target="_blank">ORM is an anti-pattern</a> Laurie Voss concentrates everything I&#8217;ve been saying on the ORM plague in all these years.

> If your project really does not need any relational data features, then ORM will work perfectly for you, but then you have a different problem: you&#8217;re using the wrong datastore. The overhead of a relational datastore is enormous; this is a large part of why NoSQL data stores are so much faster. If your data is relational, however, that overhead is worth it: your database does not merely _store_ your data, it **represents** your data and can answer questions about it on the basis of the relations captured, far more efficiently than you could in procedural code.

I don&#8217;t really know how this article managed to elude my usually long-reaching radar for such a long time.
