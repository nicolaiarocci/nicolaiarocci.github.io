Oh, joy. After many years with an iPhone, today I learned how to stop spam
calls with a single, not-really-super-secret move. 

    Settings > Phone > Silence Unknown Callers

That's it. Unknown callers now go straight to my recent calls list for me to
(eventually) review. Most importantly, the phone doesn't ring.

I initially had True Caller installed and enabled, which worked for a while.
Spammers use throw-away numbers anyway, so it's super-hard for tools like that
to keep track. In Italy, we can enlist in a nationwide "oppositions register".
Once a phone number is registered there, national call services can't call it.
I signed up on the register's opening day, which also worked for a few days.
There are ways for spammers to go around the register, such as calling from
abroad. I fell back to simply not answering unknown calls. That worked, but
unsolicited calls still caught my attention and muting the phone helped
only a little. 

The Silence Unknown Callers option has probably always been there, unbeknownst
to me. It's a godsend. Now my iPhone doesn't even try to ring anymore.
