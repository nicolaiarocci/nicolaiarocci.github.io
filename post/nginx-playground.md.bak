Every single time I need nginx, I end up spending way too much time fiddling
around with its configuration. If you're like me, rejoice! Julia Evans built
a lovely, helpful little tool called nginx playground.

The playground is available [here][1]. Make sure you also read [Julia's
introduction][2] to the tool. In there, she recounts why and, more importantly,
how she built it.
