Today, my Sunday long-reading list included New Yorker's [The Activists Who
Embrace Nuclear Power][1] by Rebecca Tuhus-Dubrow. Can nuclear power possibly
be a viable solution for climate change? Twenty or even ten years ago, my
answer would have been a big fat No. Today? Not so sure anymore.

I am surprised that the author, who clearly researched the topic well, did not
mention Bill Gates' [Mini-Reactors][2] approach to the problem. It might have
been a deliberate choice, as at some point, she does note that "scientists are
working on smaller, more nimble nuclear reactors."
