When I read *Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds
& Shape Our Futures* by Merlin Sheldrake[^3], I was stunned by the scale and
importance of the mycorrhizal network that lies beneath the surface of any
given forest in the world. The "wood wide web", as scientists started to call
it, sounded like the perfect metaphor for such an incredibly efficient,
symbiotic relation between fungi and trees.

In [The Word for Web is Forest][1][^2], Claire L. Evans brilliantly reverses the
perspective. If the wood wide web metaphor holds, we can see the world wide web
as a live, intermingled network of interconnected, initially decentralized and
perhaps symbiotic entities. The issues we face in the modern web are not
dissimilar from those faced by ill forests worldwide.

Suzane Simard, the Canadian ecologist who revealed the cooperative nature of
forests, explains that Mother Trees (the eldest trees) serve as "central hubs
of the wood wide web.  They are the strongest, the most resource-rich, with
taproots stretching far beneath the earth." When a Mother Tree dies, it shares
its resources with the forest while many other Mothers guarantee the
continuity and integrity of the ecosystem. This used to be the case with the
Web too, but not anymore.

Evans then proceeds to suggest that we should probably strive to imitate
mycorrhizal networks and (re?)build decentralized networks, with "Mother nodes
-- sites in the network bearing a responsibility of care." I'll stop here. Read
the [article][1] now, there is a lot to absorb. She doesn't go into the details
of her proposed solution, but offers us an original, courageous and pregnant
point of view to consider.
