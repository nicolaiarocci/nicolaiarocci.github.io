The slides of my talk at Percona Live 2015 (Amsterdam) are [online][1]. It was titled &#8220;MongoDB and REST APIs a Match Made in Heaven&#8221; and it was meant as an introduction to Mongo, REST principles and the Eve python framework.

Overall it has been a pleasant experience, although I found that splitting 300 attendees through seven concurrent tracks ultimately led to too much fragmentation. People often found themselves with 2-3 interesting talks all happening simultaneously, and just had to pick one.

I could only stay one day so I missed all side events, speakers dinner included, which was a bummer.
