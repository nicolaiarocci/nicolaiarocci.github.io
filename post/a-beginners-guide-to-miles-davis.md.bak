Sam Enright assembled a friendly [Beginner's Guide to Miles Davis][1]. If
you've always been curious about jazz but never really managed to get into it,
then this resource might serve as a good starting point. I cannot say I'm one
hundred per cent aligned with his choices, but we're close. One remarkable
statement I concur with is this one:

> Jazz is so interesting to me because of its fusion of intricate underlying
> structure with improvisation and spontaneity. As Ken Burns put it, jazz is
> “familiar, but brand new every night”. Moreover, I enjoy the intellectual
> demandingness of jazz as a genre. Jazz musicians seem to be the most
> thoughtful and intelligent of any genre. Many of the more Avant Garde songs
> mentioned in this post don’t sound good unless you’re really concentrating.
> Some of it sounds cacophonous to a newcomer. This is why jazz is considerably
> more difficult to get into than other genres and has a lack of listenership
> among the youth.

Sam put a lot of effort into his selection, and it shows. Should his list be
overwhelming for you, my shortcut advice would be: listen to Kind of Blue,
especially the first two tracks, So What and Freddie Freeloader. If they don't
move you, I am sorry, you're probably not a jazz person.
