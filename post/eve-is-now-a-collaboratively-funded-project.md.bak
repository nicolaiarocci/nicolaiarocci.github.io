I finally took the plunge and made [Eve][1] and [Cerberus][3] collaboratively
funded projects. Even if only mildly successful, this initiative will have
a huge impact on them, as I will be able to dedicate them at least some of my
working time.

So far (five years and counting) I have almost exclusively been working on
Eve and Cerberus in my free time. However maintaining, supporting, and
developing new features to projects of this scope takes a considerable amount
of time. And there is so much I would like to do. On my radar there are new
Client SDKs (Python, JavaScript), OpenAPI support, an overhaul of both the
documentation and the test suite. Eve-Swagger and Flask-Sentinel could and
should receive important improvements.

I believe that it is in the commercial best-interest for users of these projects
to invest in its ongoing development. Signing up, users will directly
contribute to faster releases, more features, and higher quality software. More
time will be invested in documentation, issue triage, and community support.
Essentially, by signing up they safeguard the future development of the
framework.

Quoting the Django REST framework which, along with Vue.js, showed me the path:

> Collaboratively funded software can offer outstanding returns on investment,
> by encouraging users to collectively share the cost of development
([source](https://fund.django-rest-framework.org/topics/funding/)).

If you run a business and is using Eve or Cerberus in a revenue-generating
product, it would make business sense to sponsor their development: it ensures
the projects that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained.
It can also help your exposure in the Eve community and makes it easier to
attract Eve developers.

Individual users are also welcome to make a recurring pledge if the projects
helped you in either work or personal projects. Alternatively, consider
donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying me coffee once in a while :)

In order to make the campaign as reasonable and affordable as possible, I set
up a bunch of goals and rewards, [check it out on Patreon][2].
