I spent the last couple days in Paris with a bunch of smart architects and developers who are about to deal with a complex Monolithic-to-Microservices architecture transition.

On my flight back to Italy I jotted down a few thoughts on the topic and then, this morning, the first thing that comes up on my newsfeed is [Monolith First][1] by Martin Fowler. Stunning, because the essay content totally resonates with my own notes, so much that it would perfectly serve as a recap for them.

> Going directly to a microservices architecture is risky, so consider building a monolithic system first. Split to microservices when, and if, you need it. 

And also, perhaps more importantly:

> A more common approach is to start with a monolith and gradually peel off microservices at the edges. Such an approach can leave a substantial monolith at the heart of the microservices architecture, but with most new development occurring in the microservices while the monolith is relatively quiescent. 

I find it fascinating that there is a chance that my notes and the essay were written (by astral coincidence?) in the very same minutes.
