No matter how long I've possessed a Mac and how hard I try, there will always
be a helpful keyboard shortcut hidden somewhere that I don't know about.

Today I learned about holding the `Option` key while clicking on the Copy
command in Finder. It activates the super-useful (and super-secret) "copy as
pathname" feature.

I spotted this trick on [Jamie Smith's website][1], where other handy shortcuts
(and the pretty gif above) reside.
