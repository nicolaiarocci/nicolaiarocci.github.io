Tonight someone opened [a ticket](https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1458) on
the Eve repository. I jotted down a quick reply and was about to hit the
Comment button when I thought a more articulated reply was in order. I also
want it published on my website. 

So the question is:

> Is Eve still maintained? 

My reply goes like this:

Hello, yes, [Eve](https://python-eve.org) is in 'maintenance mode', as I call
it. I don't actively develop new features anymore. Still, I am more than
willing to code-review and merge relevant pull requests, especially so if they
are bug fixes or improvements over existing features.

Long story short, after many years of development, the [funding
campaign](https://docs.python-eve.org/en/stable/funding.html)[^2] that would have
allowed me to keep working on the project failed miserably. People are using
the framework worldwide, probably making a profit out of it, but they are not
interested in investing in it[^1]. The good news is that the framework is, I think,
stable and mature enough to meet most needs.

With [Cerberus](https://python-cerberus.org), I was lucky enough to find
a worthy, skilled  maintainer in the person of
[@funkyfuture](https://github.com/funkyfuture), who's keeping the project
going. I am hoping the same happens with Eve. So, if anyone familiar with the
code-base is willing to help, this is your moment to come forward. Maybe start
with triaging open tickets, maybe pull-request for some low-hanging fruits, and
then challenge yourself with more demanding tasks, like [updating Eve to the
latest version of Cerberus](https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1278).

 I had so [many things](https://www.patreon.com/nicolaiarocci) planned for Eve.
 Hopefully someone will join the ranks, maybe take the helm, and help bring it
 to the next level.
