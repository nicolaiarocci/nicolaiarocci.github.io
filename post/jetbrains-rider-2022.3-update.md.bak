Today I upgraded to JetBrains' Rider 2022.3. Startup speed has been
enhanced, and full .NET 7 and C# 11 support is included. So far,  my favorite
feature is the conversion of regular and verbatim strings into their raw
counterparts (it's often the small, simple things.)

My second best is the fulls upport for WSL2  remote development. This one took a
good while to come out of the trenches, but better late than never, I'd say. 

And the new experimental UI? That's neat too.
