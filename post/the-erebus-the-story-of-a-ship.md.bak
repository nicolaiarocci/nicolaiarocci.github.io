I finished reading *Erebus: The Story of a Ship* by Michael Palin, an excellent
book on the dramatic adventures of the HMS Erebus with her sister ship, the HMS
Terror, first in James Clark Ross's Antarctic expedition of 1839-43, and then
during Franklin’s ill-fated Arctic expedition in search of the Northwest
Passage. I knew Michael Palin as a member of the Monty Python comedy group. As
it turns out, since 1980, he has also made many travel documentaries and books.

I first became interested in these two ships’ Arctic adventure after watching
the fictionalized TV series *The Terror* with my son Marco. As a former navy
sailor myself, I appreciated how they realistically reconstructed the
claustrophobic every-day life on board the Victorian age ships. However, I did
not enjoy how the script soon took part from the real events, turning the story
into something closer to Jurassic Park, and that’s where I stopped watching the
series.

This book, instead, is incredibly well-researched and written. To help tell the
story, Palin has traveled to various locations across the world – Tasmania, the
Falklands, the Canadian Arctic – to search for local information and experience
the terrain and the conditions that would have confronted the Erebus and her
crew. For anyone interested in history, exploration and heroic tales, this is
a book for you.
