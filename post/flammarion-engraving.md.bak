I was reading [iA's grumpy writing about GPT][1] (with which I sympathize)
when my attention was captured by the image they added to their post. It was so
fascinating that I had to research it.

As it turns out, this is the [Flammarion engraving][2], a famous wood engraving by
an unknown artist, so named because its first documented appearance is in
Camille Flammarion's 1888 book *L'atmosphère: météorologie populaire* ("The
Atmosphere: Popular Meteorology").

The print depicts a man, clothed in a long robe and carrying a staff, at the
edge of the Earth, where it meets the sky. He kneels and passes his head,
shoulders, and right arm through the star-studded sky, discovering a marvelous
realm of circling clouds, fires and suns beyond the heavens. One of the
elements of the cosmic machinery closely resembles traditional pictorial
representations of the "wheel in the middle of a wheel" described in the
visions of the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel. The caption that accompanies the
engraving in Flammarion's book reads:

> A missionary of the Middle Ages tells that he had found the point where the
> sky and the Earth touch...

The Flammarion engraving has inspired and has been used by many writers,
artists, researchers, and jack-of-all-trades. The whole story is available at
the Wikipedia page linked above.
