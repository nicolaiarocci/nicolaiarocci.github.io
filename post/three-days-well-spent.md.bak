A few weeks ago, Giulia turned eighteen.  As a birthday gift, she asked for
a skiing weekend with me.  Our family's precious little thing has
traditionally been spending the Christmas week skiing in the Alps.  We haven't
gone as much as we'd like in recent years, so I was pleasantly surprised and
thrilled that she wanted to celebrate adulthood at our special place with her
dad. 

We left home Friday at five in the morning.  At ten, we were on the slopes,
admittedly feeling a little lost without the rest of the gang.  We quickly got
into the right mood, though.  We spent three glorious, precious days together.
We can rarely spend time together, just her and me, when in town.  This
morning, I walked on the beach thinking about those three days and pondering
how lucky a dad I am.  Her birthday gift turned out as an invaluable gift for
me.
