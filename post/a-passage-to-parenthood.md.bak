A very touching Akhil Sharma in *The New Yorker*:

> Not long after we began dating, my now wife, Christine, and I started making
> up stories about the child we might have.

> We named the child—or, in the stories we told about him, he named
> himself—Suzuki Noguchi. Among the things we liked about him was that he was
> cheerfully indifferent to us. He did not wish to be either Irish (like
> Christine) or Indian (like me). Suzuki was eight, and he chose this name
> because he was into Japanese high fashion. When we told him that he couldn’t
> just go around claiming to be Japanese, Suzuki said that he was a child of
> God and who were we to say that God was not Japanese. In addition to being
> a dandy, Suzuki was a criminal. He dealt in yellowcake uranium and trafficked
> in endangered animals. Sometimes we asked him how his day at school had gone
> and he would warn, “Do you really want to be an accessory after the fact?” We
> imagined him banging on our bedroom door when we were having sex and
> shouting, “Stop! You can’t get any child better than me.”

> My wife was forty-eight and I was forty-seven, and we started inventing these
> stories as a form of play. It also soothed some hurt part of us.
