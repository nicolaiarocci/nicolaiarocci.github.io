It's been a long time coming, but I'm glad to announce that Eve 2 has finally
been released today. This release drops support for Python 2, Python 3.5 and
Python 3.6 hence the major version bump. Other than that, expect some fixes,
a new `uuidRepresentation` setting for `MONGO_OPTIONS`, and an alignment to the
latest Werkzeug/PyMongo idiosyncrasies. The full changelog is available on the
[project website][1].

The Eve project has been out for ten years. As said [elsewhere][2], I believe it's
mature and stable enough for most use cases. I consider it done in terms
of features, and it is now in 'maintenance mode'.
