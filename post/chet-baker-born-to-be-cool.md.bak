A great piece of writing on jazz has recently been posted on The Smart Set. In
[Born to be cool][1], Matthew Duffus writes about jazz trumpeter Chet Baker,
reporting about his troubled life, musical prowess, influence, and legacy. Some
facts are well known, like the reception and then the competition with trumpet
legends such as Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie; other tidbits are less known
(to me at least). On Baker legacy:

I've always listened to Barker with little attention, knowing and researching
little about the artist and his music. This article fills a hole. Also, I am
grateful to Duffus for letting me discover a gem like Live in Tokyo, an album
recorded on stage less than a year before his premature, tragic death and then
released posthumously. I am listening to it as I write this note, and man isn't
it just great.
