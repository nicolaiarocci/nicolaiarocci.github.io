I'm using JetBrains products when I'm not in (neo)vim. For C#, Rider is
fantastic, and so is PyCharm for Python. The company is incredible, too, as
today's bold move demonstrates. They moved 800 employees, got visas, new
locations and apartments, everything. Huge respect. 

I'm lucky enough to have been awarded their [Open Source License][2] for many
years, so I'm biased, but look, now I'm even proud of supporting their products
