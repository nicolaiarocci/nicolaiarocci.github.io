A new major release of the [Eve REST API Framework][1] is finally out with
a number of cool new features (MongoDB Aggregations!), few fixes, and a couple
of minor breaking changes. On the Eve blog you can find a [detailed article][2]
about this important release.

I am glad to report that the [Eve-SQLAlchemy][7] community extension, which
allows SQL databases to serve as Eve backends, has seen a surge of activity
around it. There is a new maintainer, Dominik Kellner, and a bunch of active
contributors. Work is being done to align the extension with latest Eve
release. If interested, please join the efforts there. Speaking of community
extensions, only a few days ago [Eve-Elastic][10] version 2 has been released
too.

Next major release will of course be version 0.8 and it should come relatively
soon. It will be focused on adding [Cerberus 1.0][3] support. That will add
superpowers and more flexibility to areas like data validation and API
endpoints definition. Work on adding Cerberus 1 to Eve [has actually been
ongoing][4]. In fact, we were ready to release the feature with the current
release, but I decided against it as I wanted to deliver all the new features
before the inevitable breaking changes that will come with Cerberus 1. The
idea is to let most users take advantage of new features with as little effort
as possible. They will then have the option to bite the bullet and upgrade to
0.8 at their own pace.

The current release has been cooking for a long time, way more than
I anticipated. I have simply been too busy with normal day work, the kind of
activity that pays the bills. That is good for me I guess, but not so much for
the project. I really feel like I should put more effort into Eve, Cerberus and
satellite projects Eve-Swagger, Flask-Sentinel, Eve.NET, etc. I love
working on these projects and I know a lot of people rely on them. Also, I have
big ideas that I would like to play with. At this point in time however,
I cannot afford allocating more time to not-paying-the-bill activities. Rest
assured the project is not going stale. Worse case scenario, nothing changes
and it will just proceed at current pace. But I have been wondering what would
allow me to put more into it. 

I am particulary fond of the [collaboratively funded project][5] model adopted
by the Django REST Framework, and I wonder if it would work for Eve too. Of
course I know that Eve is a smaller project with a smaller ecosystem. I also
know however that many companies and institutions, big and small are using Eve
in production and with good results. In the past I even did the occasional
consulting gig for them. Maybe some would be willing to help with some form of
financing and/or sponsorship, adopting the project in exchange for some
visibility and, more importantly, project growth?

If you have some advice to share on this topic, [please do so][6]. I am very
hesitant and unsure about this whole thing. Part of me just wants to keep going
the way it's always been, as with any form of financing also comes more
responsability. The other half of me wants to work more on this thing, make it
bigger. Eventually we will get there but, unless something changes, it will
take quite some time.

By the way, next March I am speaking about RESTful Web Services at
[Codemotion Rome 2017][8]. Presentation will include a Eve live demo, so if
you are interested in Eve and/or want to see me fail miserably and blow it up
on stage, join me there. Tickets are still available, [talk will be in
English][9], and March is a great season to visit Rome. See ya'll there.
