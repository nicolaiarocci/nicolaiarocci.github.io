Professor Ethan Mollick's [Signs and
Portents](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/signs-and-portents) analyzes what AI
has achieved, what the effects have been so far, and what we might expect in
2024.

> To ground ourselves, we can start with two quotes that should inform any
estimates about the future. The first is Amara's Law: "We tend to overestimate
the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the
long run." Social change is slower than technological change. We should not
expect to see immediate global effects of AI in a major way, no matter how fast
its adoption (and it is remarkably fast), yet we certainly will see it sooner
than many people think.

It's an insightful read that pairs well with Simon Wilson's [2023
round-up](/stuff-we-figured-out-about-ai-in-2023/). Also, his 30-second fake
video of himself telling things he never told is impressive.
