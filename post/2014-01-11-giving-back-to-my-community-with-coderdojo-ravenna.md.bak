A few days ago I tweeted:

    I&#8217;ve been working on a side project for a while. It&#8217;s about kids, coding, my town and giving back to the community. Almost ready for launch.

Now the project is [out in the wild][1] and I&#8217;m very excited about it. It&#8217;s all italian yes, but do know that CoderDojo is a [global movement][2], and starting a kids coding club in your own town would probably be great idea.

Come meet me [next week][3]. I will be giving a short talk about CoderDojo Ravenna and, most importantly, we&#8217;ll have a good pizza afterwards. Oh, and we&#8217;re [looking for mentors][4] to join us.
