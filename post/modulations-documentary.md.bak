I stumbled upon [Modulations][1], a documentary on "the evolution of electronic
music and its many genres. How the wide range of styles and scenes formed
through experimentations on sound formation." This short film (75 minutes) is
packed with guest stars of all calibers[^2], some of them genuinely pivotal to the
evolution of electronic music. Indeed, the uninitiated mind gets to know a lot
of details and amenities on the first decade or so of electronic music.

Perhaps it attempts to fit too much information into a tight timeline:
many guests, genres, places. There's a lot to unpack, and, inevitably, a lot is
left out. A series (like the excellent Hip-Hop Evolution recently aired on
Netflix) could better cover all the material. Unfortunately, Modulations was
released in 1998, when such an option wasn't even in the books. And this takes
us to my second qualm with this production: it of course doesn't cover the
recent years, let's say from early 2000s up to today. A second part would be
grand.
