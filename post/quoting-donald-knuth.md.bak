Donald Knuth challenged ChatGPT-4 with 20 questions and then submitted the results and his comments to Stephen Wolfram. The
[whole thing][1] is fascinating in many ways and worth reading.

Some remarkable quotes:

> Of course these are extremely impressive responses, sometimes astonishingly so; thus I totally understand why you and
> others have been paying attention to it.

> The most immediate impression is the quality of the wordsmithing. It's way better than 99% of copy that people
> actually write. It's definitely not like a Markov model that uses the most predictable way to continue what's already
> been said. On the other hand there are surprising lapses there too, as typical of any large system.

> Answer #10 reads as though it's the best answer yet. But it's almost totally wrong!

> It's amazing how the confident tone lends credibility to all of that made-up nonsense. Almost impossible for anybody
> without knowledge of the book to believe that those "facts" aren't authorititative and well researched.

> I find it fascinating that novelists galore have written for decades about scenarios that might occur after a
> "singularity" in which superintelligent machines exist. But as far as I know, not a single novelist has realized that
> such a singularity would almost surely be preceded by a world in which machines are 0.01% intelligent (say), and in
> which millions of real people would be able to interact with them freely at essentially no cost.

> I myself shall certainly continue to leave such research to others, and to devote my time to developing concepts that
> are authentic and trustworthy. And I hope you do the same.
