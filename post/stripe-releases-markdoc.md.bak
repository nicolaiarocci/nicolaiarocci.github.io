[Stripe docs][1] are a marvel, and every developer who's had to deal with them knows
it. After years of painful PayPal interactions, I remember the amazement and
the feverish grin on my face the first time I landed on their API reference.
Stripe API is beautifully designed, but it's the combination of good design and
excellent documentation that paved Stripe's fulgid success. 

A few days ago, they unexpectedly released [MarkDoc][2], the "powerful,
flexible, Markdown-based authoring framework" they use internally to build
their documentation. I skimmed through it only rapidly and, unsurprisingly, got
a great first impression.

Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti, who [knows better than me about docs][3], published
a solid first-glance [review of MarkDoc][4] that I think is worth reading.
Spoiler alert, I'm quoting below his excellent closing thoughts.

> The secret to Stripe docs does not lie in superior tooling or magical markup
> variants: rather, the reason for their success must be found in the quality
> of their docs team, whose information architecture needs caused Markdoc to
> happen. This is the kind of magic that happens when you provide enough
> technical resources to your technical writers and trust them to do the right
> thing.

*Update*: MarkDoc even received [John Gruber's endorsement][5]. That's quite an
achievement as Gruber is renowned for dismissing most Markdown extensions.
