title: "Strong opinions on software development"

After six years in the field, Chris has [shared][1] his strong opinions on
software development practices, languages, and methodologies. I like his
attitude. Willingness to continuously put one's personal views under scrutiny,
eventually adapting or even changing them as needed, is not a common trait. Not
in our field. While I generally agree with most of his opinions, I feel the
urge to comment on a few of them.

> Typed languages are better when you're working on a team of people with
> various experience levels

Typed languages are better, period.

> Software architecture probably matters more than anything else. A shitty
> implementation of a good abstraction causes no net harm to the code base.
> A bad abstraction or missing layer causes everything to rot.  

Perfect. I am stealing this line.

> Clever code isn't usually good code. Clarity trumps all other concerns.

Good *and* clever code is very possible, though. Agree on the second part.

> Bad code can be written in any paradigm

Ã‡a va sans dire

> So called "best practices" are contextual and not broadly applicable. Blindly
> following them makes you an idiot

Not following them also makes you an idiot.

> Designing scalable systems when you don't need to makes you a bad engineer.

But how do I know in advance whether I need to be scalable or not? Not always
an easy call. Also, scalability doesn't necessarily imply complexity.

> In general, RDBMS > NoSql

In general, use the right tool for the right job.

> Functional programming is another tool, not a panacea.

The jury is out on this one. In my admittedly limited experience, functional
programming tends to win over OOP. It's not a coincidence that most OOP
languages keep adding functional features (looking at you, C#.).

> Pencil and paper are the best programming tools and vastly under used

Old fart me concurs.

> Trading purity in exchange for practicality is usually a good call

Don't get carried away with that.

> Talking directly to the customer always reveals more about the problem, in
> less time, and with higher accuracy

*:s/always/sometimes*

> The word "scalable" has a mystical and stupefying power over the mind of the
> software engineer. Its mere utterance can whip them into a depraved frenzy.
> Grim actions have been justified using this word

I plea guilty on this one.

> Despite being called "engineers," most decision are pure cargo-cult with no
> backing analysis, data, or numbers

I am a software craftsman.

> People who stress over code style, linting rules, or other minutia are insane
> weirdos

I am an insane weirdo.

> Code coverage has absolutely nothing to do with code quality

It also has nothing to do with *tests* quality.

> Monoliths are pretty good in most circumstances

*:s/most/some*

> TDD purists are just the worst. Their frail little minds can't process the
> existence of different workflows.

Ouch. This hurts.

I am not sure I would have had so many well-formed opinions only six years in.
