A few months ago I started [my review of Lansing's *Endurance: Shackleton's
Incredible Voyage*][1] with these words:

> Of all the stories of maritime adventures Iâ€™ve read, that of the Endurance,
> masterfully told by Alfred Lansing in this book, is the most incredible and
> shocking.

And I meant that. As the book's title suggests, that story is simply
unbelievable, yet true. Imagine my astonishment this morning at the news that
the Endurance was found in the depths of the Antarctic.

> Scientists have found and filmed one of the greatest ever undiscovered
> shipwrecks 107 years after it sank. The Endurance, the lost vessel of
> Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, was found at the weekend at the
> bottom of the Weddell Sea. 

More [here][2], along with incredible footage.
