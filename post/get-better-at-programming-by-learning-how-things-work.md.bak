Once again, Julia Evans has great sensible advice up on [her site][1].

I appreciate her note on how today we work with so many complex systems that it
is next to impossible to understand all of them.  The experienced developer
comes at peace with that, acknowledges ignorance, and, more importantly,
understands when it's worth digging deeper. In other words:
