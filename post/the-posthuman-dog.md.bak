Flo, our dog, spent her whole fifteen-years long life with us. Many, many times
after she passed away, I wondered if she lived a happy dog life or not. In [The
posthuman dog][1] (Aeon), Jessica Pierce poses a fascinating question that
somehow helps find answers to my troubling question:

Unfortunately, the answer I can infer from the article is not very pleasant to
my guilt.
