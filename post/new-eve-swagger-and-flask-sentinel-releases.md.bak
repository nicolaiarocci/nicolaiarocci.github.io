It's maintenance day in my little Python world. I just released new versions of
two small but apparently quite popular packages:


- [eve-swagger](https://pypi.org/project/Eve-Swagger/), the OpenAPI/Swager
extensions for [Eve](https://python-eve.org)-powered APIs, hits v0.1.4. It's
just a single fix for API breakage introduced with the previous release;
details available
[here](https://github.com/pyeve/eve-swagger/blob/master/CHANGES.rst). Thanks to
Asger Gitz-Johansen for the help with this release.

- [Flask-Sentinel](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Sentinel/), an Oauth2 Provider
for Flask, hits v0.0.8. This also is a small release that fixes 500 errors if
you were using unpinned versions of redis. This time, my gratitude goes to Adrian Cin.

Enjoy.
