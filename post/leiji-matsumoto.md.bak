On February 13, 2023, about ten days ago, [Leiji Matsumoto][3] left this world.
A phenomenal Japanese manga artist, he created several space operas that
influenced me as a kid. Matsumoto directed *Space Battleship Yamato*[^2], wrote
and illustrated *Galaxy Express 999*[^1], and then released the magnificent
*Space Pirate Captain Harlock*. Regarding visual operas, I suspect my
fascination with space, astronomy and all things science has much more to do
with these three than with the Star Wars movies that came later, or Star Trek.

What I did not know until the other day, however, is that Matsumoto worked with
Daft Punk. In 2001, the artist and his studio produced all the videos for Daft
Punk's *Discovery* album. I distinctly remember watching the *One More Time*
video and being blown away. It was fantastic and also fascinating in a strange
way, but I couldn't pinpoint the reason. Now I understand. I didn't make the
connection back then, but Matsumoto's touch immediately drew me back to my
childhood fantasies, themselves sprouting from the artist's animes.

In 2003, Toei Animation released *Interstella 5555*, an "animated musical
science fiction film" and a visual companion to the *Discovery* album. It has
no dialogue, minimal sound effects, and all (most?) of *Discovery*'s music. I
watched it this morning and loved every moment of it.
