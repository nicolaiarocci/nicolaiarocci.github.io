Last Saturday I went on a motorcycle trip with [my club][2]. We had about forty
motorcycles, many coming from afarâ€”a tremendous turnout considering how
advanced the season is. This event was particularly involving for me, as my
local group was in charge of the organization. We were going to visit the
[Foreste Casentinesi National Park][1], which isn't far from our hometown. 

We know those roads and their surroundings well; we call them home, yet
I insisted on scouting the planned route not once but twice, and I think it was
crucial to the event's success. On the narrow road that climbs to a mountain
pass, we spotted a mobile traffic light (for a road construction site) with
a long (six minutes!) red/green cycle. We arranged a plan in case the
motorcycle's column split at the light: almost one kilometer past the red
light, there was a safe place where the forward group could safely stop off the
road and wait for the rest to rejoin. All the participants were informed at the
departure briefing: if you get stopped at the red light, don't get
over-stressed: we'll be waiting for you one kilometer down the road. You won't
see us, but we'll be waiting for you safely. Don't rush it, and don't stop to
phone us. We won't be at the first apparently-good parking place but at the
second spot, which, despite not looking as good, is way safer (less gravel on
the ground). Situations like these can cause confusion and danger to a large
group of motorcycles roaming on narrow, steep mountain roads which are often in
poor conditiong. The reconnaissance ride allowed us to plan for several
potential pitfalls like this one.

Anyways, I'm rambling. It was a great late autumn trip. The woods are
spectacular this time of the year, which is why we hit that area with this
trip.
