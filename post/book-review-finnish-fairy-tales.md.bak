Over the years, Iperborea, one of my favorite Italian publishers, has been
publishing an unofficial Nordic Tales series. Their renowned nordic fiction
series includes one fairy tale volume per year, usually published in December,
just for Christmas. The first book was Lapland Tales in 2014, and then they
continued with Danish, Icelandic, Swedish, Faroe,  Norwegian, Greenlandic and
then Finnish in 2021. I've been greedily reading each one of them, usually as
my last book of the year. This year I was a little bit late, as [reported][1].

Until now, 2020's Greenlandic Legends has been my favorite, mainly because it's
partly different from the others, which all share a common Scandinavian
cultural background. In this regard, this year's Finnish Tales is even more
remarkable. Quoting the short, excellent final essay by the translators Giorgia
Ferrari and Sanna Maria Martin[^2]:

> Within the Nordic panorama, Finland holds a unique position and has a precise
> identity: entering Finnish culture means coming into contact with the
> Finno-Ugric world, starting from the language, which has nothing to do with
> the Scandinavian ones, which are only geographically close. At the same time,
> Finland is anything but an island separated from its surroundings: its
> particular position between East and West has made it, if anything,
> a borderland, a point of intersection between different cultures, enriching
> it with influences from both directions. And this can only be evident even in
> popular tales.

Indeed, in these tales, you find echoes of myths and tropes from Scandinavian
culture but always intertwined with unique Finnish themes. Notable examples
are:

- The *tietäjä*, whose supernatural power arises from great knowledge.
- The *vetehinen*, a male (!!!) water spirit of the forest.
- The *syöjätär*, the devourer, or the "wicked mother."
- The *nimikkopuu*, a tree planted on somebody's birth; tied to their destiny
- The shamanic rituals, often associated with the use of magical words and songs

The principal collector of Finnish folklore was Eero Salmelainen (1830-1867),
who published four seminal titles from which all of the stories in Finnish
Tales are selected. Of course, Grimm's influence is evident in Salmelainen's
work. Remarkably though, Salmelainen started his collection forty years later
than the Grimms. One reason might be that until then (and up until now, I might
add), Finnish folklore has always been hiding in the shadow of Kalevala's
poetic poetry.

 [^2]: Short, informative essays enrich each one of Iperborea's Nordic Tales volumes. These are essential in framing the content within the correct background, outlining the links between Nordic cultures, and revealing the sources. Take the Kalevala. I have had it in my library since many years ago, but I didn't correlate it with Finnish folklore until I saw it mentioned in the essay.
