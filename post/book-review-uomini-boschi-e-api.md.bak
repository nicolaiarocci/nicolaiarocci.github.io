The book[^1] delivers on the author's promise in the introduction. Mario Rigoni
Stern is an author I have always admired and loved. His biography is touching,
his themes are awe-inspiring, and his writing is simple, clean, and enjoyable.

This work is a collection of short stories he wrote over the years, primarily
published in magazines and newspapers. The first part of the book, about
one-third, is about Rigoni Stern's struggles and experiences as a wartime
prisoner during WWII. The rest is mostly about his wilderness adventures,
either as a hunter or a nature-dweller (he spent most of his life living on the
Asiago plateau in the Italian alps.) As is often the case with Rigoni Stern,
his hunting adventures are proxies to show his deep connection, respect, and
empathy for the creatures he preys on, which is counter-intuitive for the
modern, educated reader. 

Mario Rigoni Stern was one of the very last of his age when nature still played
a primary role in everyday life. Despite his early success as a writer, he was
lucky, or smart enough, to keep living in his relatively secluded place in the
mountains, from which he could observe the unstoppable transformation of our
society from afar.
