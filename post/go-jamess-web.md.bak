It's now old news that the [James Webb Telescope][3] was successfully launched
on Christmas Day. But last Saturday marked another historic moment for this
incredible human artifact:

> After a quarter-century of effort by tens of thousands of people, more than
> $10 billion in taxpayer funding, and some 350 deployment mechanisms that had
> to go just so, the James Webb Space Telescope fully unfurled its wings. The
> massive spacecraft completed its final deployments, and, by God, the process
> went smoothly.

Ars Technica's Eric Berger has long been my go-to pusher for space-related
stuff. [His report][1] on Saturday's milestone is accurate and to the point as
usual. Today he has [another article][2] on ESA Arianne 5's fundamental
contribution to the mission. I love how modern, successful space missions are
almost always the result of no-bullshit joint efforts by multiple international
actors.

*Update:* The James Webb Telescope [has reached its final destination][4].
