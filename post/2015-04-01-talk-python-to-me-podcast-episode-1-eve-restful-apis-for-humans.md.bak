I was lucky enough be the first guest for the shiny new [Talk Python To Me Podcast][1] hosted by Michael Kennedy. In this episode we talk about Eve an my other open source releases, which gives us an excuse to touch on a variety of topics such as Polyglot Programming, New Microsoft and the .NET evolution, MongoDB and the Open Source eco-system as seen from the point of view of an old fart who has been spending most of his career in closed systems.
