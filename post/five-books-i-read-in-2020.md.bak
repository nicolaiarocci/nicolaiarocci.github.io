Here are five books I read in 2020 that I would recommend. I read several fine
books last year, so please check out my [reading history][1] if you are unsatisfied
with this selection. 

*[Mani: Travels in the Southern Peloponnese][mani], by [Patrick Leigh
Fermor][plf]*. I love Patrick Leigh Fermor. Over the years, I read almost
everything he wrote. He has been described as "a cross between Indiana Jones,
James Bond, and Graham Greene," and for a good reason. He bridges the genres of
adventure story, travel writing, and memoir to reveal an ancient world living
alongside the twentieth century. Here he carries the reader with him on his
journeys among the Greeks of the mountains, exploring their history and
time-honored lore. The Mani, at the tip of Greece's-and Europe's-southernmost
peninsula, is one of the most isolated regions of the world. Cut off from the
rest of the country by the high range of the Taygetus and hemmed in by the
Aegean and Ionian seas, it is a land where the past is still very much a part
of its people's daily lives. 

*Bonus tip*. The book that got me hooked with Patrick Leigh Fermor is *[A Time of
Gifts][atog]*, a memoir of the first part of his journey on foot across Europe,
from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople in 1933/34. A fascinating read.

*[Swann's Way][sw], by [Marcel Proust][mp]*. This is the first volume of Marcel
Proust's *In Search of Lost Time*, arguably the twentieth century's finest novel.
Indeed, while reading the first part, a boy's impressions of his family and
neighbors, all brought dazzling back to life years later by the taste of
a madeleine, I could appreciate why Marcel Proust is considered the best writer
of all time. The second part, the short novel *Swann in Love*, "an incomparable
study of sexual jealousy," which follows, is also excellent. I have to admit
I kept postponing this book basically for all my life, as I was intimidated by
its fame. I am glad I finally got to read it as a mature adult but make no
mistake, this book is a must-read, in due time, for any avid reader. 

*[The Master and Margarita][mm], by [Mikhail Bulgakov][mb]*. An audacious
revision of Faust and Pontius Pilate's stories, *The Master and Margarita* is
recognized as one of the essential classics of modern Russian literature. I was
surprised by both the audacity and modernity of the story and Bulgakov's own
writing style. Of all the scenes, those that probably impressed me the most
were Satan's ball and Margarita's flight. *The Master and Margarita* is a true
masterpiece. With *Swann's Way*, it sits right there at the top of my classics
stack.

*[Helgoland][hl], by [Carlo Rovelli][cr]*. Carlo Rovelli is a theoretical
physicist and writer. His work is mainly in quantum gravity, where he is among
the founders of the loop quantum gravity theory. In this book, Rovelli
recounts the story of what has been acknowledged as the most radical scientific
revolution of modern times: quantum physics. In June 1925, in Helgoland, a bare
and windswept isle in the North Sea, a 23 years old Werner Heisenberg started
it all. Since then, in almost one century, quantum physics revealed many
controversial if not disturbing new ideas, most of them confirmed over time,
leading to all kinds of technological innovations. I don't think this book has
been translated to languages other than Italian as of yet. By googling a little
bit around, I found English translations announced by Penguin and other
editors.

*[De Brevitate Vitae (On the Shortness of Life)][sl], by [Seneca][s]*. I am
impressed by this short book. I expected it to be a challenging, hard descent
into the ancient philosopher's mind. It was a joyful read instead. Even today,
Seneca's writings offer potent insights into the art of living, the importance
of reason and morality and continue to provide profound guidance to many
through their eloquence, lucidity, and timeless wisdom.

## On a more personal note
I strive to read good books. Of course, defining what makes a good book is is
very subjective. In my case, good books challenge my understanding of the world
in which I live. That might sound too broad (and ambitious) of a goal, and
probably it is. I tend to read all kinds of different books: novels, essays,
classics, with non-fiction gravitating towards topics such as history, science,
and, only more recently, economy and finance. As you might have guessed from
the list above, lately, I have been reading classics a lot. I don't read too
many programming or computer science books. Not these days anyway. As I get
older, I prefer to distance myself from the topics I focus on at work all day
long. 

Reading is my zen mode. I do other activities that achieve similar results,
such as walking, hiking, motorcycling and working out, but reading, I come to
recognize, reigns supreme. It's been with me since I was a kid and, also,
compared to the other activities, it is very affordable in terms of time and
effort.

I read 28 books in 2020. It appears I have performed slightly below my recent
average. I once [commented on Twitter][m] that "the number of books per year"
does not make for a useful metric. At the very least, it doesn't tell the whole
story. Take 2018 and 2019. In 2018 I read 30 books; in 2019 I only read 25. It
sounds like a steep decline until we look at the "pages read per year" metric.
As it turns out, I actually read more in 2019 than in 2018 (8394 vs. 8322. Ok,
it's more of a tie.)
