There is a new episode up at Channel9 TecHeroes. It is called [Real Life .NET Cross Platform][1] and it is about developing production-ready, cross-platform applications with today&#8217;s .NET. In the interview we talk about [SimpleCache][2], an asynchronous, permanent and cross-platform key-value object cache powered by SQLite3. The project is still a work in progress so there is no NuGet package available yet, but it is quite usable already. The [talk slides][3] are also available.
