Memoirs of Hadrian and its author Marguerite Yourcenar have always induced
a cautious fear in me. I fretted the tome for high literary circles, one of
those texts so infused with learned quotations and obscure literary references
as to be utterly indigestible to the average reader. Despite their evident
reputation, I relegated the Memoirs to the bottom of my reading list for a long
time. When I stumbled on another reference to Yourcenar's work a couple of
weeks ago, I finally decided to plunge and pull the Memoirs off the shelf.

It was immediately apparent that I was facing something exceptional. The
memoirs are drafted by an elderly emperor Hadrian for his young friend "Mark,"
the future Marcus Aurelius. Hadrian does not flinch. He tells of his many great
successes but does not hide his mistakes and weaknesses. The former he points
out so that his protégé can steer clear of them; the latter he investigates,
not without that indulgence that every elder is entitled to. 

The emperor writes of practical things: the organization of the state and
turbulent provinces management (he devoted a significant part of his career to
visiting the remote provinces, so much that he was criticized for being too
absent from Rome), the conspiracies he foiled and the problematic management of
the enormous army, with all its quarrelsome commanders and legions. But Hadrian
also tells about his private life: the boundless ambition of his youth, the
passion for Hellenic culture and how it influenced his reign. He writes about
his fleeting loves and the relationship with the young Antinous, his only true
love, tragically lost way too soon. To overcome the trauma of the loss, Hadrian
does what is precluded to ordinary mortals: deifies his beloved. He establishes
a cult of  Antinous, which, surprisingly so in the eyes of modern man,
flourishes everywhere in the vast empire, taking different forms depending on
the receiving religion. Like any ordinary person, the emperor wonders about the
eternal questions that plague humanity. He offers answers to some while others
are left unanswered, impenetrable even to the divine emperor.

The text is compelling, intimate and full of such accurate details that I soon
wondered whether what I was reading was a literary invention or a historical
document. The truth lies somewhere in between. According to the sources,
Hadrian did write an autobiography, but it is lost. The Memoirs is indeed
a work of fiction; the result, however, of meticulous historical research
carried out, between ups and downs, for thirty years. Everything that Hadrian
recounts is historically attested. Where doubts exist, the author chooses the
most reliable historical hypothesis, not failing at times to adjust, rehash, or
add where necessary. The author's notes, included in my edition, are invaluable
in fully understanding and appreciating the amount and quality of work done.
Yourcenar conceived the idea in 1924-25, when she was only 22 years old, only
to publish it in 1951. Nowadays, historical novels are common but not in the
early twentieth century, when the memoir letter form was probably unheard of.
The result is a daring and unconventional work for the time, a high-risk
publication that was instead an immediate success with both the public and the
critics who acclaimed it.

My long-held fears were unfounded after all. Although with some guilty delay,
this book goes straight into my all-time top ten.
