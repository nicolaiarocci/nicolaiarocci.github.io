So the motorcycle-touring season has started, albeit a little late this year
because of the COVID situation, and I've been avidly pursuing it. On Sunday,
I embarked on a 700 km trip from my place to the Dolomites and back.

It's been a glorious day.  We ([Antonio][1] and I) visited many renowned
Mountain Passes, enjoyed stunning views, ate great food and chatted like
there's no tomorrow.

I took my GoPro along with me. I wanted to record some scenes to inspire my
motorcycle club[^2] comrades. However, I admit I was dubious that it would be
worth the hassle. Filming while driving would be difficult; editing and
assembling the cuts later would be tedious. Moreover, I have almost no
experience with this stuff.

The video is available on YouTube, and I already know it's probably too long.
Ideally, it should feature live voice recording, possibly a second camera
point-of-view, and, heck, even some drone footage[^3]. But it's only the first
attempt; it will have to do. 

Contrary to my expectations, filming on the go wasn't too stressful, and
editing was.. ok I guess. However, once it was done and I finally got to watch
it, I realized the obvious: it will primarily serve as a remarkable memory of
a glorious day. Eventually, it will also inspire some of my club comrades; but
that's now a secondary goal.
