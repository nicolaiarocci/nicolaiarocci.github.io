Kottke [reports][1] this juicy excerpt from Jonny Greenwood's interview at npr:

> Thom [Yorke]'s band had a keyboard player — [whom] I think they didn't get on
> with because he played his keyboard so loud. And so when I got the chance to
> play with them, the first thing I did was make sure my keyboard was turned
> off ... I must have done months of rehearsals with them with this keyboard,
> and they didn't know that I'd already turned it off.

> They made quite a racket, quite a noise. It was all guitars and distortion
> — and so I would pretend to play for weeks on end and Thom would say, "I
> can't quite hear what you're doing, but I think you're adding a really
> interesting texture, because I can tell when you're not playing." And I'm
> thinking, "No, you can't, because I'm really not playing." And I'd go home in
> the evening and work out how to actually play chords and cautiously over the
> next few months, I would start turning this keyboard up. And that's how
> I started in with Radiohead.
