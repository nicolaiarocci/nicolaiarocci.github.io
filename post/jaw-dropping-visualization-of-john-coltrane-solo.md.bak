Open Culture [shared][1] a "jaw-dropping visualization of John Coltrane's 'Giant
Steps' solo."

Indeed, it is stunning, beautiful and valuable. A visualization like this makes
music much more accessible. Quoting Open Culture:

> Coltrane’s complexity is daunting for the most accomplished musicians. How
> much more so for non-musicians? It can seem like “you need a doctorate of
> music to go anywhere near his recordings,” Nicholson writes. But “nothing
> could be further from the truth.” With its dancing lines and circles,
> Brother’s visualization gives us another way to appreciate the “sheer joy of
> music making and the power and energy of his playing” that inspires students,
> serious fans, and newcomers alike through “universal values that still speak
> to us now.”

I suddenly want all my music visualized like this.

My nerdiness alarm immediately went off, and I wanted to know more, so I dug
a little. Open Culture presentation is remarkable, but what's mind-boggling is
the author's [in-depth article][2] on the fractal structure of the solo. It's
all about fractals, baby!
