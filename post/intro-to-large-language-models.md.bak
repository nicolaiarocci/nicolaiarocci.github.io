Andrej Karpathy has a very well-done [Intro to Large Language Models](https://youtu.be/zjkBMFhNj_g?si=5tJNFaDcK-FBWnWK)
video on YouTube. As a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI and with a two-year hiatus working on Tesla
Autopilot, Karpathy is an authority in the field. He is also good at explaining hard things.

As a Kahneman reader, I appreciated the *Thinking Fast and Slow* analogy proposed at about half-length in the video:
"System 1" (fast automatic thinking, rapid decisions) is where we're now; "System 2" (rational, slow thinking, complex
decisions) is LLMs next goal. Also, I suspect Karpathy's intriguing idea of LLMs as the center of a new "operating
system style" is not too far off from what will emerge soon. The final segment on AI security and known attack vectors
(jailbreaking, prompt injection, data poisoning) is also super interesting.

On his website, Karpathy also has a promising [zero-to-hero video series](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html), "a
course on building neural networks from scratch, in code."
