Chelsea Wald in *Nature*:

> Scientists say that urine diversion would have huge environmental and
> public-health benefits if deployed on a large scale around the world. That’s
> in part because urine is rich in nutrients that, instead of polluting water
> bodies, could go towards fertilizing crops or feed into industrial processes.
> According to Simha’s estimates, humans produce enough urine to replace about
> one-quarter of current nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers worldwide; it also
> contains potassium and many micronutrients (see ‘What’s in urine’). On top of
> that, not flushing urine down the drain could save vast amounts of water and
> reduce some of the strain on ageing and overloaded sewer systems.
