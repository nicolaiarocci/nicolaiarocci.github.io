Laura Pepe teaches ancient greek law at the University of Milan. In her career,
she published many academic works and also scientific divulgation books. The
Voice of the Sirens falls in the latter category.

For the ancients, the Sirens were horrifying monsters, half birds and half
women. Yet, they had something that made them irresistible: the voice,
persuasive and captivating. In this book, along with other similar mythological
figures such as Circe, Calypso and Elena, Sirens are protagonists of a journey
that starts from Homer and focuses on the Athens of the 5th century. Athens,
the city of democracy and, even before that, of the word. Retracing
little-known stories and famous passages of prose and poetry, Professor Pepe
investigates the incredible potential of *peith√≥*, persuasion, the word that
both seduces and convinces.

The word, the most powerful sovereign, can carry out the most divine deeds: it
knows how to convince the true and the just, but it can also deceive and
mislead. Pepe shows its strengths by looking at the protagonists of politics
who address people gathered in assembly, and then at accusers and accused, who
work hard to convince the court's judges. Finally, she looks at the masters of
persuasion, the sophists, who were also active in 5th century Athens.

Professor Pepe does a great job at reminding us how and why Ancient Greece
- between history, myth, poems and philosophy - has shaped our way of thinking
and dealing with the world. In almost thousands of years, we have significantly
progressed in many incredible ways. Yet the mechanisms that drive modern
societies have evolved only marginally and, what's humbling, the fundamental
questions raised by the great minds of that age remain unanswered[^1].
