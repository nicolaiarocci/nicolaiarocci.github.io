A couple of weeks ago I went hiking the Translagorai, an 80 km-long trail that
traverses the whole Lagorai mountain range in the Alps. The route takes place
in a mountain environment where the anthropic pressure is reduced, especially
compared to the more famous nearby Dolomites destinations. There are very few
managed huts, most of which do not offer overnight stays, and relatively few
bivouacs (emergency huts, usually dislocated in the most isolated areas along
the hike). These characteristics make the Translagorai very attractive to
those looking for wild hikes to be travelled in complete self-sufficiency
with tent, food, etc. There is rich evidence (remains of barracks, trenches)
dating back to the First World War. Translagorai is a brutal, wild, restless,
and beautiful route reserved for well-trained, experienced mountain hikers.

I did the route 25-ish years ago with a couple of friends. A tent, some food,
super-heavy backpacks, and off we went, up and down the ravines. Overall, it
was a great experience that also destroyed us. I have fond memories of those
days when

> the grass was greener, the light was brighter, with friends surrounded, the nights of wonder.

I never thought I would go back and do the route again, especially not at 50.
As the saying goes, however, never say never. My nephew, to whom I somehow
passed on my love for wilderness, asked for advice on an exciting route to
take with a friend. I sent him a long email with a series of proposals for
two-three day tours. In the end, I made the mistake of mentioning the
Translagorai as a more brutal but satisfying alternative. I certainly didn't
expect them to choose it; I added it more as a comparison than anything else.
Yet, they were so excited about the prospect of venturing out on that route
that I couldn't convince them otherwise. A little apprehensive about the
difficulties they would face (they don't have much experience) and sensing
untold fears during the preparation chats, I ended up hinting that I could
accompany them if so they wished. I expected a polite refusal. Why would two
twenty-somethings want to spend four days alone in the wilderness with a gruff
fifty-year-old? To my surprise, they immediately said yes, and with great
relief, I think. I was part of the team. I couldn't believe it. Twenty-five
years later, I was going back, and I only had 48 hours to prepare.

Granted, we met more people than I expected or remembered, but other than that,
the route has remained pretty much unchanged. Back in the day, we didn't follow
the official, high-altitude course, which always stays on the crest of the
Lagorai range. This time we did, and I found it even more beautiful and
satisfying. I suspect I'm more fit today than I was in my youth, which might
explain how I could happily follow these two young war machines for four full
days, high and down the trail, like there was no tomorrow. The two boys
impressed me beyond belief. If I provided some help, I think it was because of
the mountaineering experience, but sure as hell, they did not need help with
motivation and performance. When I made my first trip there, I'm sure we
suffered much, much more pain, and we were about their age. Hiking equipment
has improved tenfold since the mid-90s, but today backpacks are still heavy.
Mountains, they certainly didn't flatten at all. We slept in tents and ate
our food, usually camping by some small, beautiful mountain lake or mountain
pass. That, also, hasn't changed.  I am happy to report that Translagorai is
still the king of badass wilderness routes in the Alps. Go there only if you
are ready, however, or it will tear you apart.

night in a First-World War barrack along the route, but when we got there late
in the evening, it was in such poor conditions that we decided to continue
another hour, then detour a little to reach a small lake, past a mountain fork,
which the map showed as a possible pitch site. Situations like these is why you
want to have someone experienced with you.*
