Wrapped by Spotify, the 2022 edition just landed in my mailbox. This year I
listened to twenty-four different genres. My favorite was Indie Jazz, followed
by Hip Hop, Jazz, Electronica and Rock. I am a little puzzled about that Hip
Hop in second place. In total, I spent 14143 minutes listening to music, 80
percent more than other listeners in Italy did. 

My favorite track was [Fear Of The Dawn][1] by Jack White, followed by [The
Beginning][2] by Native Soul, [Sorcery][3] by The Toxic Avenger, [Spirals][4] by
Django Django, and [Boy From Michigan][5] by John Grant.

My favorite artists have been Max Gazzè (a recent rediscovery-and reappraisal),
Rosalía, Accademia Bizantina, Subsonica and Jack White. Again, color me a
little surprised. I like Max Gazzè, but I'd swear I listened to many other
artists for at least the same amount of time, if not (way) more. But what do I
know? One cannot beat the algorithm, right?

My “music personality,” as Spotify calls it, would be that of a “serious
relationship: you carefully select the music and artists you listen to but have
a lot of affection to give. If you like an artist, then it’s serious.” Which I
have to admit is kind of my general attitude, not just toward music. Here's my
top 101 (not a typo) for 2022:
