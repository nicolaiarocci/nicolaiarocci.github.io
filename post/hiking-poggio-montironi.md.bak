Yesterday was a beautiful, sunny, cold winter Sunday. I felt like going out and
enjoying nature, so I took a solo hike in the Foreste Casentinesi National Park,
about an hour's drive from home.

This one marks my very first technology-assisted hiking adventure. It may seem
weird for someone who's been hiking for so long, is a notorious geek and is a
professional computer programmer to have never used technology before. A trail
map and sometimes a compass were all I was used to, and deliberately. I wanted
to avoid technology in this aspect of my life. I welcomed the orientation
challenges and superbly looked down at the crowds of phone-smartwatch-compulsive
hikers I met on the route. Alas, 2023 was the year I surrendered my motorcycling
habits to intercom systems and GPS navigation, and that spoiled me. In a couple
of situations yesterday, the app spared me some trouble by warning me of the
wrong direction I was going. Nothing major. I would've realized the error and
backtracked, but being these the shortest and coldest days of the year, I
appreciated not risking getting caught by dusk. Also, I found that I can turn on
voice-assisted navigation as I do on my motorcycle, and that's nice (albeit
surreal - walking alone in the wilderness, miles from anybody, with a voice
coming out of nowhere and whispering when I should take turns on the trail): it
avoids looking at the cellphone all the time so I can stay focused on the
experience even more, I suspect, than before when the don't-get-lost alarm bell
was constantly ringing in the back of my head. 

And then, of course, there's the selfish and ego-boosting pleasure of sharing
your achievement with the masses. I mean, [look at this
beauty](https://out.ac/IPVine)!

The Poggio Montironi hike was an excellent circular tour, advisable all year
round and especially suggestive in winter because of the barren and scenic ridge
(perhaps too sunny in midsummer) that culminates with the more than 1,000 meters
of Poggio Montironi. Near the destination stands an always-open bivouac that can
be useful as shelter. At the same time, the ancient castle of Spescia, reduced
to ruins but with considerable environmental value, on the return ridge gives
the hike additional reasons for interest.

Caution on the descent: Two or three turns could be more noticeable, but they
are well reported in the GPX track. A fallen tree (surmountable) interrupts the
trail near the ford of the Rio Sasso.
