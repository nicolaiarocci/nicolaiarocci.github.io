Learn in public, it gives superpowers1. Also, in recent years, adopting POSSE was the best thing I did for my personal development.
I should do better. Post more TILs, for example.

Overall the process was pretty straightforward. The few issues I went through were easy to solve and well documented. Things got more involved with the EF Core 6 transition, especially with the Npgsql Entity Framework Core Provider.
The official ASP.NET Core 5.0 to 6.0 migration guide was my first stop. It offers the perfect entry point, rich with in-depth links. At this stage, I am not interested in switching to the new .NET 6 minimal hosting model (aka Minimal APIs). I think it’s a significant improvement, and we will likely adopt it for new projects, but our production projects aren’t going to be refactored right away. Should minimal APIs also prove to be remarkably performant, we’ll reconsider them1.

If humans were to disappear from the face of the Earth, what might dogs become? And would they be better off without us?

I jotted down a quick reply and was about to hit the Comment button when I thought a more articulated reply was in order. I also want it published on my website.
So the question is:
Is Eve still maintained?
My reply goes like this:
Hello, yes, Eve is in ‘maintenance mode’, as I call it. I don’t actively develop new features anymore. Still, I am more than willing to code-review and merge relevant pull requests, especially so if they are bug fixes or improvements over existing features.

Nelson, Charlemagne is stripped back from the years of mythologizing and idolizing that have occurred since his death. He is presented as distinctly human, and this book is the first time I have felt I could reasonably understand Charlemagne as the man he was, not the man he has since been painted to be. Moreover, Nelson is excellent in her discussions of Charlemagne’s wives and their roles. For example, the commonplace assumption that Fastrada was a cruel person is questioned, and she emerges as a capable companion and queen instead.

Each period has its introductory chapter, followed by chapters dedicated to the most influential composers of the era. The choice is comprehensive and well cared for, with the most relevant names well-investigated both in biography and works. For each composer, Swafford also offers some listening suggestions. Biographies thicken as we get into the contemporary era. Here, some are limited to just a page or two while others, obviously those of the author’s preferred composers, remain as thorough as those of the older periods.

Like a plant, I absorb the mild October sun. At the same time, I attentively listen to the sounds of the forest. Suddenly I hear a stomping of dry leaves about twenty meters ahead of me, slightly to my right. A wolf emerges out of the thicket. He stops for a moment, glances around, then starts crossing the clearing. A few moments and another wolf appears. After a brief pause, he follows his pal. They parade right in front of me, sinuous, silent, and feral. They do not see or hear me, and yet I am right there, by their side, in plain sight1. It is all over in a few seconds. The couple leaves the clearing and disappears into the forest. I stand sitting there, shocked and in complete awe.

He suggested joining the Developers Italia initiative and moving my project to the their organization on GitHub “to enjoy enhanced visibility and broaden the audience”. I politely refused. I did not doubt my counterpart’s good faith. At the same time, I was concerned about the possible long-term consequences of a seemingly easy move. Moving a GitHub project away from your profile or an organization you control means ceding control over it. I was assured I would keep control of the project. But what happens if sometime in the future, when people in charge might even have changed, they revoke my access rights? As long as I am involved with my project, I should be in control. Also, I was not convinced that the move would help promote the project. We live in the search-engine age; people search for solutions to their problems. I was, and still am, confident that if I did my due diligence and my project is any good, people will find it1.
