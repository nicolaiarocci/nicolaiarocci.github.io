This is an important topic for anyone who is maintaining an open source project, especially when it comes to the process of reviewing and accepting code contributions.
At some point during the debate, I argued that when a maintainer merges a pull request, he (or she) implicitly agrees on being responsible for that code. That seemed to strike some surprise into most attendees.
Yes, in theory any contributor is just a ping away so in case trouble arises one can always reach him, or her. Unfortunately this is not always the case. While some contributors will fully embrace your project and keep helping after their initial contribution, truth is that a good number of them will just move on, never to be seen again.
There’s nothing wrong with that. Not everyone has spare time to devote to your project, which is perfectly fine. It is natural for most people to contribute what they need to a project and then go on their way. Actually, one could argue that most projects grow and prosper precisely thanks to this kind of contributions.
However this attitude can become an incumbent when big chunks of code get merged, usually as new (big) features. Good practices advice against merging huge pull requests. In fact they are rare and when they do come, it is a good idea to ask for them to be split into smaller ones. But no matter the format, a huge contribution is likely to hit a project one day or another. It might even come from more than one person: a disconnected and distributed team of contributors who have been patiently tinkering on a side branch or a fork for example. When this happens, and provided that the contribution is worth merging, the maintainer should then ask him/herself the obvious question: am I willing to deal with the consequences of this merge?

It’s supposed to help in addressing a subtle issue that we’ve been dealing with, but I believe it can also emerge as a very useful all-around tool. I am posting about it in the hope of gathering some feedback from Eve contributors and users, so that I can better pinpoint design and implementation before I merge it to the main development branch.
What is the OpLog? The OpLog is a special resource that keeps a record of operations that modify the data stored by the API. Every POST, PATCH, PUT and DELETE operation can eventually be recorded by the oplog.
At its core the oplog is simply a server log, something that’s always been on the Eve roadmap. What makes it a little bit different is its ability to be exposed as a read-only API endpoint. This would in turn allow clients to query it as they would with any other standard endpoint.

An OrderedDict is a dict that remembers the order that keys were first inserted. If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is left unchanged. Deleting an entry and reinserting it will move it to the end.
Problem is, this stuff is only available in the standard library since Python 2.7 while my project also needs to support Python 2.6. Fortunately there’s a back-port available and it is only a pip install away:
# make OrderedDict available on Python 2.6-2.4 $ pip install ordereddict ordereddict is based on the awesome recipe by Raymond Hettinger, works with Python 2.4-2.6 and, most importantly, is a drop-in replacement for OrderedDict.
However if you want your code to run seamlessly on all Pythons there’s still some work to be done. First of all you want to make sure that the appropriate OrderedDict is imported, either the standard library version (for Python 2.7 and above) or the back-port release.

Especially so if you are using InstallShield for building your deployment package. We’ve been going through this a few days ago and it’s been kind of a wild ride. I thought I could pin the whole thing down so that others might enjoy a painless journey through all this mess.
Portable Class Libraries and .NET Framework 4 The first thing you should know is that while the .NET Framework 4 does support PCLs, in fact it won’t run them without a patch. For whatever reason, Microsoft decided that PCL compatibility wasn’t a worth a 4.0.4 update. That leaves us with the need to not only make sure that target machines are running the up-to-date .NET4 release (v4.0.3) but also that they’ve been updated with KB2468871.
You might be wondering why this is an issue in the first place. We could simply install the .NET Framework 4.5 which is backward compatible with the .NET4 and includes the afore mentioned KB2468871. Even better, we could just target the .NET 4.5 on our PCL. Problem is that besides iOS, Android, WinPhone and Silverlight we also want our libraries to run seamlessly on as many Windows editions as possible, Windows XP included. Here is the catch: .NET4 is the last framework version to run on Windows XP. And yes, we got the memo, Microsoft officially abandoned Windows XP a while ago so why bother? Well it turns out that millions of users are still running XP, especially so in the enterprise and SMB. These PCL are targeting exactly that, precisely the accounting software segment, and believe me there’s a huge number of users happily invoicing and accounting on their old-fart-but-still-splendidly-doing-its-job-for-cheap boxes. Oh and the .NET Framework 3.5 is not an option as it doesn’t support Portable Classes at all.
