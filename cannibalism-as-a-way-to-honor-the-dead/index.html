<meta name=keywords content="links,cannibalism"><meta name=description content="As it appears, cannibalism was much more widespread than previously thought, and perhaps for
more complex reasons than we think. To honor the dead, for example.

Our ancestors have been eating each other for a million years or more. In
fact, it seems that, down the ages, around a fifth of societies have practised
cannibalism. While some of this people-eating may have been done simply to
survive, in many cases, the reasons look more complex. In places like Gough’s
cave, for example, consuming the bodies of the dead seems to have been part of a
funerary ritual. Far from a monstrous affront to nature, cannibalism may be a
way of showing respect and love for the dead, say some archaeologists."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/cannibalism-as-a-way-to-honor-the-dead/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon16x16.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon32x32.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=mask-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/cannibalism-as-a-way-to-honor-the-dead/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://nicolaiarocci.com/cannibalism-as-a-way-to-honor-the-dead/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nicola Iarocci"><meta property="og:title" content="Cannibalism as a way to honor the dead"><meta property="og:description" content="As it appears, cannibalism was much more widespread than previously thought, and perhaps for more complex reasons than we think.
