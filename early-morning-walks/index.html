<meta name=keywords content="walking,fitness"><meta name=description content="An essential part of my fitness routine is my early morning walks. On weekdays, I leave my home on the outskirts of my small provincial town, walk to downtown, and then return. It&rsquo;s a brisk, almost hour-long loop before I sit down at my desk. On weekends, I take walks in the woods or to the beach, or if I have the time, head out for a mountain hike.
These walks make my daily zen moment. Sometimes I come back and, if I try, I can&rsquo;t remember what I was thinking about the whole time. Other times, however, and often, I mentally organize my day, or solve coding problems (or, more likely, study solutions to try later, once I&rsquo;m at the keyboard). Sometimes I plan or dream about my future mountain trips, or remember past adventures, or plan motorcycle trips. Sometimes I listen to podcasts or music: there are mornings when I want to be on my own; others when listening to a well-told story is just what I need. In any case, once I get back, I feel refreshed, oxygenated, relaxed, and ready for the day&rsquo;s work."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/early-morning-walks/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon16x16.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon32x32.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=mask-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/early-morning-walks/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://nicolaiarocci.com/early-morning-walks/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nicola Iarocci"><meta property="og:title" content="Early morning walks"><meta property="og:description" content="An essential part of my fitness routine is my early morning walks.
