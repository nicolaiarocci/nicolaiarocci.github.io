Our goal was to visit the beautiful Dolomites in the Italian Alps1. We had twenty motorcycles on the road, evenly split between modern classics (Bonnevillles in all their variations) and adventure bikes (Tigers new and old). A great turnout considering that the weather forecast for the weekend wasn’t exactly great. Of all the TOMCC members who registered, only two were missing because they tested positive for COVID.\nSeeing old and new friends and spending time together roaming the mountain roads felt great. We even visited places I didn’t know about, namely the Soffia Falls at Mis Lake and Castle Andraz. After lunch at Malga Misurina, where the food was good and personnel not so much, we were supposed to cover another long stretch of road up to the springs of the Piave river. When we looked in that direction and saw the intimidating front of blue/black clouds ready to open their floodgates on us, we changed our minds and headed back to our base camp. We still got flooded, but certainly not as much as if we’d pressed on with the original plan. The next day, a handful of us continued roaming the countryside for more fantastic views, corners, food, and camaraderie.\nI’m grateful to Sandro (“Momo”) for organizing this event. I know very well how demanding and stressful running a motorcycle event can be. So far, we’ve always been lucky to have people willing to take on the challenge and volunteer to hold events all around the country. As long as this continues, we’ll have a bright future and lots of fun.\nLast year, I went there with a fellow TOMCC member and recorded a YouTube video. Check it out here.
