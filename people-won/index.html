I was struck by Boris&rsquo;s reply to one question from the crowd: &ldquo;Hey, why did you build a CLI tool instead of an IDE?&rdquo; (emphasis is mine):
Yeah, it&rsquo;s a good question. There are two reasons. We started this at Anthropic, where people use a broad range of IDEs. And some people use VS code. Other people use Zed, Xcode, Vim, or Emacs. And it was just hard to build something that works for everyone. And so the terminal is just the common denominator. The second thing is that at Anthropic, we see firsthand how quickly the model is improving. I think there&rsquo;s a good chance that by the end of the year, people won&rsquo;t use IDEs. And so, we want to prepare for this future and avoid over-investing in UI and other layers on top. Given the way the models are progressing, it may not be practical to work on them soon."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=http://localhost:1313/people-won/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=http://localhost:1313/images/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=http://localhost:1313/images/favicon16x16.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=http://localhost:1313/images/favicon32x32.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=http://localhost:1313/images/favicon.ico><link rel=mask-icon href=http://localhost:1313/images/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=http://localhost:1313/people-won/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/people-won/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nicola Iarocci"><meta property="og:title" content="People won"><meta property="og:description" content="I’m just back from watching Mastering Claude Code in 30 Minutes, a talk by Boris Cherny, who, I learned, created Claude Code.
