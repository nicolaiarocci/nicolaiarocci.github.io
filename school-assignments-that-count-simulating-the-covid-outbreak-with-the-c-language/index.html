A recovered person cannot infect a healthy person nor become sick again after coming in contact with a sick person.\nIn more prosaic terms: the world comprises a 30*50 cell grid. Of these, 200 cells are randomly selected to be alive. Throughout the simulation, each of these cells can be in one of the following three states: healthy, sick, or recovered. If a cell is ill, at the next cycle, all neighbouring cells will also be diseased. A cell stays sick for 14 cycles. At cycle 15, it is healed.

In general, she doesn’t ask for help, nor do I ask her about her progress. If she reaches out to me, it’s only for serious trouble, and when that happens, I enjoy working with her. Besides, while I do a lot C# these days, I don’t do C since aeons ago, so it’s great to get back to it every once in a while.\nAbove, the healthy population inhabiting its 1500-cells world, right before the outbreak.\nHalfway through the simulation, 86 cells are healthy, 46 are sick, and 68 are healed.\nEnd of the simulation. It doesn’t matter how many times you run it; the number of people who were never infected is stunningly low by the end. Moreover, a simulation like this one, albeit simplified, reveals how dramatically an epidemic can spread if not contained with social distancing.\nI was pleasantly surprised by this assignment. Here we have a teacher who doesn’t constraint herself to the standard, well-established routine. Instead, she keeps her students engaged and challenges them. At the same time, she takes the chance to educate them on the current sanitary emergency. Giulia tells me that her teacher was inspired by a March 2020 Washington Post article: Why outbreaks like coronavirus spread exponentially, and how to “flatten the curve.” That’s excellent work. It includes several animated simulations, Giulia’s assignment being one of them.\nSubscribe to the newsletter, the RSS feed, or follow @nicolaiarocci on Twitter\n","wordCount":"412","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-04-05T07:05:25+01:00","dateModified":"2021-04-05T07:05:25+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://nicolaiarocci.com/school-assignments-that-count-simulating-the-covid-outbreak-with-the-c-language/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Nicola Iarocci","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/avatar.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/opensource/ title=code><span>code</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/speaking/ title=conferences><span>conferences</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/books-i-have-read/ title=library><span>library</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/archives/ title=archive><span>archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">School assignments that count: simulating the COVID outbreak with the C language</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-04-05 07:05:25 +0100 +0100'>April 5, 2021</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Giulia got an exciting assignment from her teacher:</p><blockquote><p>Write a C program that simulates (a simplified version of) COVID outbreak
