      <description>Most people likely already know and use the voice dictation feature in iOS and macOS all day, but I&amp;rsquo;ve only now seen the light.
Yesterday, I discovered I could dictate text notes to my iPhone, even offline. It works with Obsidian, WhatsApp, and any other app where I need to enter text, like the Safari search box. I suck at entering text on the phone. I also hate WhatsApp audio messages, but I often recur to them as, again, I suck at typing text on the phone.</description>

<p>Yesterday, I discovered I could dictate text notes to my iPhone, even offline.
It works with Obsidian, WhatsApp, and any other app where I need to enter text,
like the Safari search box. I suck at entering text on the phone. I also hate
WhatsApp audio messages, but I often recur to them as, again, I suck at typing
text on the phone. I can instead dictate those messages, and they will render as
text as if I typed them; what a revelation!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not entirely a discovery; I knew I could do that and did it occasionally,
primarily for quick lookups.  However, I underestimated how good and valuable
the feature is.</p>
<p>This morning, I discovered the obvious: I can do the same on the Mac. The
MacBook keyboard has a microphone function key, and guess what? It&rsquo;s for voice
dictation, and it works seamlessly. I can even start typing on the keyboard,
switch to dictation on the fly, and then go back to typing without interruption.
It works offline and has built-in multi-language support, just like iOS. Voice
dictation will likely change how I take notes, send messages, and perform other
tasks. Take notes, for example; until today, I rarely write them down when away
from the keyboard.</p>
