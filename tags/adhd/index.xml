      <description>I read ADHD—A Lifelong Struggle today. It&amp;rsquo;s the best thing I&amp;rsquo;ve read on ADHD so far. Its advice is grounded in experience and applies to everyone: those who think ADHD is a crock or, worse, an excuse, those who suffer from it, and those who have family members or friends who suffer from it.
And we all punish ourselves. That&amp;rsquo;s the real tragedy of this illness. We are our biggest detractors because we know what we&amp;rsquo;re capable of.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read <a href="https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html">ADHD—A Lifelong Struggle</a> today.
It&rsquo;s the best thing I&rsquo;ve read on ADHD so far. Its advice is grounded in
experience and applies to everyone: those who think ADHD is a crock or, worse,
an excuse, those who suffer from it, and those who have family members or
friends who suffer from it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we all punish ourselves. That&rsquo;s the real tragedy of this illness. We are
our biggest detractors because we know what we&rsquo;re capable of. Better than our
teachers. Better than our parents. They always said that they could &ldquo;see our
potential,&rdquo; but we saw ten times what they did. Every day. We saw the things we
could do, in our heads, and hated ourselves for not doing them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are so many good lines in the article that I highlighted twelve whole
paragraphs with many more deserving, and I struggled to pick one to quote here.</p>

      <title>Medieval monks also had focus issues</title>

      <description>Medieval monks also needed help with focus and attention. Joel J Miller discusses this in What Monks Know About Focus, the latest issue of Miller&amp;rsquo;s Book Review, which I recently discovered and shows great promise.
While technology has evolved in the last fifteen hundred years, the human brain has not. And few people in the ancient world cared as much about the challenges of attention and distraction as monks. Our reasons might differ today, but we have much to learn nonetheless.</description>

<p>The focus problem predates the advent of the modern age with all its continuous,
unstoppable, but always alluring background noise. I wonder if ADHD was also a
thing back then and how many were possibly affected. We will never know.</p>
