      <description>Wet, cold, and foggy winter day in the plains, I knew it would be splendid in the highlands. At the last minute and even a little late by my usual safety standards, I packed my backpack and dashed into the hills. To avoid being late or having to return in the dark, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even stop eating, munching on two bars as I walked, but it was worth it.
Rio Petroso is a rather complex and articulated circular tour, with frequent environmental changes, configuring itself among the most arid of the entire Park territory; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do this route at the height of summer.</description>

the highlands. At the last minute and even a little late by my usual safety
standards, I packed my backpack and dashed into the hills. To avoid being late
or having to return in the dark, I didn&rsquo;t even stop eating, munching on two bars
as I walked, but it was worth it.</p>
<p>Rio Petroso is a rather complex and articulated circular tour, with frequent
environmental changes, configuring itself among the most arid of the entire Park
territory; I wouldn&rsquo;t do this route at the height of summer.</p>
<p>Another peculiarity of this hike is the dense presence of ruined houses,
precious testimonies of the glorious Apennine civilization history that lasted
until the late 1960s, with the departure of the population to the valley floors
or, more often than not, the plains.</p>
<p>The geological peculiarity is constituted by the so-called &ldquo;Verghereto marls&rdquo;
(named after the typical locality where they, in fact, overbearingly
characterize the landscape), which appear especially along the ridge of Rio
Petroso: they give rise to a barren environment, with erosion phenomena
reminiscent of those of gullies but with, in addition, an almost exotic
suggestion in their lunar nudity.</p>
<p>When I got to the car, I realized I had forgotten the headlights on. It&rsquo;s a good
thing I hurried on the route (and recently changed the battery), or I would have
been stuck there, 10 km from civilization, with no phone signalâ€”an adventure I
gladly spared myself.</p>
