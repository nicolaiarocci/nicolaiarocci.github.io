      <description>Wet, cold, and foggy winter day in the plains, I knew it would be splendid in the highlands. At the last minute and even a little late by my usual safety standards, I packed my backpack and dashed into the hills. To avoid being late or having to return in the dark, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even stop eating, munching on two bars as I walked, but it was worth it.
Rio Petroso is a rather complex and articulated circular tour, with frequent environmental changes, configuring itself among the most arid of the entire Park territory; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do this route at the height of summer.</description>

the highlands. At the last minute and even a little late by my usual safety
standards, I packed my backpack and dashed into the hills. To avoid being late
or having to return in the dark, I didn&rsquo;t even stop eating, munching on two bars
as I walked, but it was worth it.</p>
<p>Rio Petroso is a rather complex and articulated circular tour, with frequent
environmental changes, configuring itself among the most arid of the entire Park
territory; I wouldn&rsquo;t do this route at the height of summer.</p>
<p>Another peculiarity of this hike is the dense presence of houses, which are
precious testimonies of the glorious Apennine civilization history that lasted
until the late 1960s, with the departure of the population to the valley floors
or, more often than not, the plains.</p>
<p>The geological peculiarity is constituted by the so-called &ldquo;Verghereto marls&rdquo;
(named after the typical locality where they, in fact, overbearingly
characterize the landscape), which appear especially along the ridge of Rio
Petroso: they give rise to a barren environment, with erosion phenomena
reminiscent of those of gullies but with, in addition, an almost exotic
suggestion in their lunar nudity.</p>
<p>When I got to the car, I realized I had forgotten the headlights on. It&rsquo;s a good
thing I recently changed the battery and hurried on the route, or nearly so, or
I would have been stuck there, 10 km from civilization, with no phone signalâ€”an
adventure I gladly spared myself.</p>

      <title>I met with the wolves</title>

      <description>I sit under a wild apple tree at the edge of the clearing. Like a plant, I absorb the mild October sun. At the same time, I attentively listen to the sounds of the forest. Suddenly I hear a stomping of dry leaves about twenty meters ahead of me, slightly to my right. A wolf emerges out of the thicket. He stops for a moment, glances around, then starts crossing the clearing.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I sit under a wild apple tree at the edge of the clearing. Like a plant,
I absorb the mild October sun. At the same time, I attentively listen to the
sounds of the forest. Suddenly I hear a stomping of dry leaves about twenty
meters ahead of me, slightly to my right. A wolf emerges out of the thicket. He
stops for a moment, glances around, then starts crossing the clearing. A few
moments and another wolf appears. After a brief pause, he follows his pal. They
parade right in front of me, sinuous, silent, and feral. They do not see or
hear me, and yet I am right there, by their side, in plain sight<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It is all
over in a few seconds. The couple leaves the clearing and disappears into the
forest. I stand sitting there, shocked and in complete awe.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the scene above is real. It happened to me last Sunday, in the wild
Apennines, in a place I&rsquo;ve been visiting for years. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of animals
there: wild boar, deer, badgers, foxes. I knew wolves frequent the area but
meeting them, in the plain day? No way. I dreamed about it, of course, but
never expected it would really happen.  I had goosebumps, and I still have them
now as I write this. I keep telling myself it&rsquo;s impossible. And yet, I have
photos on my cellphone. In the heat of the moment, I somehow managed to snap
a couple. My family confirms the wolves. It was not a dream.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I think that having been sitting there motionless and not producing any sound for a long time did the trick. By pure luck, I also happened to be downwind to them.
