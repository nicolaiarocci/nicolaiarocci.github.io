      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dave Rupert, reasoning on why he likes books:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books are strange objects. Chapters and chapters of coherent research and lived experiences assembled by people who wanted to put it all down in one place. Edited by actual editors who like editing. Designed— down to the weight of the paper, the typography, and the illustration on the cover— to make the experience of reading it enjoyable. Books are uncanny and impractical objects. A terribly inefficient way to encode information from one brain to another, but an excellent way to tell a story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
