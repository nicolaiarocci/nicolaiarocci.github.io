      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re playing a point, it is the most important thing in the world. But
when it’s behind you, it’s behind you&amp;hellip; This mindset is really crucial, because
it frees you to fully commit to the next point… and the next one after that…
with intensity, clarity and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, whatever game you play in life&amp;hellip; sometimes you’re going to
lose. A point, a match, a season, a job&amp;hellip;  it’s a roller coaster, with many ups
and downs.  And it’s natural, when you’re down, to doubt yourself. To feel sorry
for yourself. And by the way, your opponents have self-doubt, too. Don’t ever
forget that.  But negative energy is wasted energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
