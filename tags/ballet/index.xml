      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Serena and I went to see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spellboundance.com/&#34;&gt;Spellbound Contemporary Ballet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Art of Fugue&lt;/em&gt;, a performance based on J.S. Bach&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Fugue&#34;&gt;unfinished work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been gifting Serena two subscriptions to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teatroalighieri.org&#34;&gt;our city&amp;rsquo;s theater&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s dance season for some years. She loves dance, both classic and contemporary. I thought I did not. Usually, she goes with one of her best friends. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember ever going before, and yesterday, I only went because none of her friends were available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I have been gifting Serena two subscriptions to <a href="https://www.teatroalighieri.org">our city&rsquo;s theater</a>&rsquo;s dance season for some years. She loves dance, both classic and contemporary. I thought I did not. Usually, she goes with one of her best friends. I don&rsquo;t remember ever going before, and yesterday, I only went because none of her friends were available.</p>
<p>I know nothing about ballet, and truthfully, I expected to get relatively bored. Instead, I got excited. I sat there in the stalls, open-mouthed, the whole time. The nonstop one-hour and ten-minute show flew by; it was delightful.</p>
<p>Many of the dancers&rsquo; movements, individual but primarily choral, reminded me of Hayao Miyazaki&rsquo;s masterful sequences, particularly those in which one or more characters literally &ldquo;liquefy&rdquo; to the ground or otherwise amalgamate, which happens quite often in his works. I wonder if Mauro Astolfi, the choreographer, took inspiration from Miyazaki or if it was just a figment of my imagination (Serena, I later found out, had the same thoughts.)</p>
<p>Next year, Serena&rsquo;s best friends are staying at home. There&rsquo;s a new ballet fan in town.</p>
