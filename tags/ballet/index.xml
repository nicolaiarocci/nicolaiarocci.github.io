      <description>Yesterday, Serena and I went to see Spellbound Contemporary Ballet&amp;rsquo;s The Art of Fugue, a performance based on J.S. Bach&amp;rsquo;s unfinished work.
I have been gifting Serena two subscriptions to our city&amp;rsquo;s theater&amp;rsquo;s dance season for some years. She loves dance, both classic and contemporary. I thought I did not. Usually, she goes with one of her best friends. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember ever going before, and yesterday, I only went because none of her friends were available.</description>

<p>I have been gifting Serena two subscriptions to <a href="https://www.teatroalighieri.org">our city&rsquo;s theater</a>&rsquo;s dance season for some years. She loves dance, both classic and contemporary. I thought I did not. Usually, she goes with one of her best friends. I don&rsquo;t remember ever going before, and yesterday, I only went because none of her friends were available.</p>
<p>I knew nothing about ballet, and truthfully, I expected to get relatively bored. Instead, I got excited. I sat there in the stalls, open-mouthed, the whole time. The nonstop one-hour and ten-minute show flew by; it was delightful.</p>
<p>Many of the dancers&rsquo; movements, individual but primarily choral, reminded me of Hayao Miyazaki&rsquo;s masterful sequences, particularly those in which one or more characters literally &ldquo;liquefy&rdquo; to the ground or otherwise amalgamate, which happens quite often in his works. I wonder if Mauro Astolfi, the choreographer, took inspiration from Miyazaki or if it was just a figment of my imagination (Serena, I later found out, had the same thoughts.)</p>
<p>Next year, Serena&rsquo;s best friends are staying at home. There&rsquo;s a new ballet fan in town.</p>
