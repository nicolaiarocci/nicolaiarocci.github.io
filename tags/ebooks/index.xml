      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a Kindle for a long time now, and I love it. But I keep buying paper books. Lots of them. Actually I buy a lot more books than ebooks and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even stop there. Admittedly, I am guilty of repeatedly buying paper editions of ebooks I&amp;rsquo;ve read on the Kindle.
For a very long time I&amp;rsquo;ve not been able to tell the precise reason why I keep going back to traditional books.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Kindle for a long time now, and I love it. But I keep buying paper books. Lots of them. Actually I buy a <em>lot</em> more books than ebooks and it doesn&rsquo;t even stop there. Admittedly, I am guilty of repeatedly buying paper editions of ebooks I&rsquo;ve read on the Kindle.</p>
<p>For a very long time I&rsquo;ve not been able to tell the precise reason why I keep going back to traditional books. It&rsquo;s not about the reading experience or the sexiness of turning physical pages. Well of course that matters too, as I&rsquo;ve always been kind of a book fetishist, but since the very beginning of my love-hate relationship with the Kindle I&rsquo;ve always known there had to be something else, and I couldn&rsquo;t pin it down.</p>
<p>Then yesterday it finally struck me. I was visiting the awesome <a href="http://www.turismo.ra.it/eng/Events/Events-and-initiatives/Exhibitions/Silent-books.-Destination_-Lampedusa">Silent Books</a> exhibition with the kids, and there was this <a href="http://www.suzyleebooks.com/">Suzy Lee</a> quote pinned on the wall, and I couldn&rsquo;t stop reading it over and over.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In turning the pages of a book,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a little world opens and closes,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>enclosed in a frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Story ends, the book closes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The world closes too.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s quickly placed on a shelf.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Art can be placed on a shelf.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shelf-sized art.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that beautiful? (*)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s about the shelves. It&rsquo;s about surrounding myself with those little worlds I&rsquo;ve been exploring. I suddenly realized that several times every day, while I&rsquo;m furiously coding or when I&rsquo;m just walking around the house or heck, even while I&rsquo;m reading a book, each day my eyes like to indulge on those shelves, the vivid memories of my reading experiences. That&rsquo;s something the files stored on my precious little Kindle can&rsquo;t offer me.</p>
<p>That also explains why I only tend to buy what I call &rsquo;throw away&rsquo; books on the Kindle. These aren&rsquo;t necessarily bad books (or I wouldn&rsquo;t buy them in the first place). They are mostly leisure readings, you know, thrillers and the like: something that&rsquo;s entertaining to read but it isn&rsquo;t likely to leave me with a long lasting memory, or emotion.</p>
<p>(*) turns out the Border Trilogy, Suzy Lee&rsquo;s book from which the quote__ is taken, has not been published in english, which is a shame. This is a (probably poor) translation of mine_.</p>
