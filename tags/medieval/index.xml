      <title>There&#39;s no such a thing as the &#39;Dark Ages&#39;</title>

&lt;p&gt;The actual phrase ‘Dark Ages’ itself derives from the Latin &lt;em&gt;saeculum obscurum&lt;/em&gt;, which Caesar Baronius – a cardinal and Church historian – came up with around 1602. He applied the term exclusively to the tenth and eleventh centuries.  However, and very significantly in his use of the term, Baronius was not decrying a state of scientific malaise, or a particularly turbulent political period – he’s talking about a lack of sources surviving from that time.  Indeed, Baronius sees the cut off point for the dark ages to be the Gregorian reforms of 1046, following which we see a massive increase in surviving documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>So:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a time that historians use the term ‘Dark Ages’? Yeah, we do use it to talk about source survival rates. It’s not a term we use as a value judgment, however. We just mean that we don’t have a lot of evidence to go off of.</p></blockquote>

&lt;p&gt;Imagine, for a moment, that you are walking along a dirt road in the seventh century Middle East. The sun is hot, the
air is dry, your feet are tired. It’s been a long journey, by boat and foot, from your home in Constantinople to where
you find yourself now: outside of the walls of the mountainous river city of Antioch. In the bright sunlight, you
strain your eyes to catch a distant glimpse of the sight you’ve come all this way to see – and then suddenly, you do.
A bright stone pillar, stretching as tall as a church dome with an unsteady-looking wooden platform; and atop it a
tiny, bedraggled, flinty old man.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<blockquote>
<p>You’ve found him: the Pillar Saint.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To our modern eyes, this is a profoundly weird image – but it would have been a recognisable, even iconic, one if we
were living in the early medieval Middle East. To explain how we got here – and how that guy got on that pillar - we
need to step back and tell the origin story of one of the most recognisable characters in medieval life: the monk.</p></blockquote>
