      <description>As a non-native English reader, I had to look up the true meaning of &amp;ldquo;Unbundling&amp;rdquo; as a neologism. According to Wikipedia
Unbundling is a neologism to describe how the ubiquity of mobile devices, Internet connectivity, consumer web technologies, social media and information access in the 21st century is affecting older institutions (education, broadcasting, newspapers, games, shopping, etc.) by &amp;ldquo;break[ing] up the packages they once offered (possibly even for free), providing particular parts of them at a scale and cost unmatchable by the old order.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a non-native English reader, I had to look up the true meaning of
&ldquo;Unbundling&rdquo; as a neologism. According to Wikipedia</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unbundling is a neologism to describe how the ubiquity of mobile devices,
Internet connectivity, consumer web technologies, social media and
information access in the 21st century is affecting older institutions
(education, broadcasting, newspapers, games, shopping, etc.) by &ldquo;break[ing]
up the packages they once offered (possibly even for free), providing
particular parts of them at a scale and cost unmatchable by the old
order.&rdquo; Unbundling has been called &ldquo;the great disruptor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every year Benedict Evans, former Andreessen Howoritz partner and now
independent analyst, produces a big presentation digging into macro and
strategic trends in the tech industry. This year, <em>The Great Unbundling</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Covid brought shock and a lot of broken habits to tech, but mostly, it
accelerates everything that was already changing. 20 trillion dollars of
retail, brands, TV and advertising is being overturned, and software is
remaking everything from cars to pharma. Meanwhile, China has more smartphone
users than Europe and the USA combined, and India is close behind</p>
<ul>
<li>technology and innovation will be much more widely spread. For that and
lots of other reasons, tech is becoming a regulated industry, but if we step
over the slogans, what does that actually mean? Tech is entering its second
50 years.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this work to be worth studying. It draws a detailed, informed picture of
what happened in technology and the economy these last years. It also offers
insights, with some foresight, into what might come next.</p>
