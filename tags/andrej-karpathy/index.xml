      <title>Karpathy: I have never felt this much left behind as a programmer</title>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There&amp;rsquo;s a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quoting Andrej Karpathy</title>

&lt;p&gt;I always struggle a bit with I&amp;rsquo;m asked about the &amp;ldquo;hallucination problem&amp;rdquo; in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the LLM&amp;rsquo;s hazy recollection of its training documents, most of the time the result goes someplace useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only when the dreams go into deemed factually incorrect territory that we label it a &amp;ldquo;hallucination&amp;rdquo;. It looks like a bug, but it&amp;rsquo;s just the LLM doing what it always does.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
