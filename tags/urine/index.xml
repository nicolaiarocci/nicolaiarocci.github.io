&lt;p&gt;Scientists say that urine diversion would have huge environmental and
public-health benefits if deployed on a large scale around the world. That’s
in part because urine is rich in nutrients that, instead of polluting water
bodies, could go towards fertilizing crops or feed into industrial processes.
According to Simha’s estimates, humans produce enough urine to replace about
one-quarter of current nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers worldwide; it also
contains potassium and many micronutrients (see ‘What’s in urine’). On top of
that, not flushing urine down the drain could save vast amounts of water and
reduce some of the strain on ageing and overloaded sewer systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
