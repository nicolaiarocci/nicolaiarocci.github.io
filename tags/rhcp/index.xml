      <description>&lt;p&gt;I reluctantly admit that it was Spotify&amp;rsquo;s Discover Weekly that let me discover Flea&amp;rsquo;s new solo single, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.last.fm/music/Flea/_/A+Plea&#34;&gt;A Plea&lt;/a&gt;. It’s jazz, and it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful. There are echoes of Fela Kuti and Sun Ra in it or, well, that was my first thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lyrics may sound naive at first, but they&amp;rsquo;re not. Instead, they strike me as lucid and match my general feeling about what&amp;rsquo;s going on lately, the risks we&amp;rsquo;re taking as a society, and what we should do to move beyond and improve ourselves. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/TmyjzvQv5bA?si=szHcpTKj_8P_9DjG&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; is 100% Flea, and it&amp;rsquo;s adorable (it is directed by his daughter).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I reluctantly admit that it was Spotify&rsquo;s Discover Weekly that let me discover Flea&rsquo;s new solo single, <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flea/_/A+Plea">A Plea</a>. It’s jazz, and it&rsquo;s beautiful. There are echoes of Fela Kuti and Sun Ra in it or, well, that was my first thought.</p>
<p>The lyrics may sound naive at first, but they&rsquo;re not. Instead, they strike me as lucid and match my general feeling about what&rsquo;s going on lately, the risks we&rsquo;re taking as a society, and what we should do to move beyond and improve ourselves. The <a href="https://youtu.be/TmyjzvQv5bA?si=szHcpTKj_8P_9DjG">video</a> is 100% Flea, and it&rsquo;s adorable (it is directed by his daughter).</p>
<p>Digging further, I <a href="https://www.nonesuch.com/journal/flea-releases-new-original-song-plea-2025-12-02">learned</a> that Flea has a “trumpet album” coming out next year (apparently the trumpet was his first instrument), and that Nick Cave lent his voice to one of the tracks. In the process, I also learned about Cave’s trenchant <a href="https://stereogum.com/2300054/nick-cave-clarifies-stance-on-red-hot-chili-peppers-discusses-forthcoming-flea-collaboration/news">opinion of RHCP</a>, which thankfully doesn&rsquo;t prevent Cave from admiring and respecting their bassist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t care about the act of politics. I think there is a much more transcendent place above it where there’s discourse to be had that can actually help humanity, and actually help us all to live harmoniously and productively in a way that’s healthy for the world. There’s a place where we meet, and it’s love.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Flea</p>
<p>I am eager to listen to the new album.</p>
