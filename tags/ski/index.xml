      <description>A few weeks ago, Giulia turned eighteen. As a birthday gift, she asked for a skiing weekend with me. Our family&amp;rsquo;s precious little thing has traditionally been spending the Christmas week skiing in the Alps. We haven&amp;rsquo;t gone as much as we&amp;rsquo;d like in recent years, so I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled that she wanted to celebrate adulthood at our special place with her dad.
We left home Friday at five in the morning.</description>
