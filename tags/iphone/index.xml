      <description>Oh, joy. After many years with an iPhone, today I learned how to stop spam calls with a single, not-really-super-secret move.
Settings &amp;gt; Phone &amp;gt; Silence Unknown Callers That&amp;rsquo;s it. Unknown callers now go straight to my recent calls list for me to (eventually) review. Most importantly, the phone doesn&amp;rsquo;t ring.
I initially had True Caller installed and enabled, which worked for a while. Spammers use throw-away numbers anyway, so it&amp;rsquo;s super-hard for tools like that to keep track.</description>

calls with a single, not-really-super-secret move.</p>
<pre><code>Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Silence Unknown Callers
</code></pre>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Unknown callers now go straight to my recent calls list for me to
(eventually) review. Most importantly, the phone doesn&rsquo;t ring.</p>
<p>I initially had True Caller installed and enabled, which worked for a while.
Spammers use throw-away numbers anyway, so it&rsquo;s super-hard for tools like that
to keep track. In Italy, we can enlist in a nationwide &ldquo;oppositions register&rdquo;.
Once a phone number is registered there, national call services can&rsquo;t call it.
I signed up on the register&rsquo;s opening day, which also worked for a few days.
There are ways for spammers to go around the register, such as calling from
abroad. I fell back to simply not answering unknown calls. That worked, but
unsolicited calls still caught my attention and muting the phone helped
only a little.</p>
<p>The Silence Unknown Callers option has probably always been there, unbeknownst
to me. It&rsquo;s a godsend. Now my iPhone doesn&rsquo;t even try to ring anymore.</p>
