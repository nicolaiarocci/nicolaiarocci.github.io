      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was interviewed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mauroservienti&#34;&gt;Mauro Servienti&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spreaker.com/show/dotnetpodcast&#34;&gt;DotNetPodcast&lt;/a&gt;. The
theme was my experience as an open-source maintainer on both the Python and C#
stacks. We also discussed the ongoing evolution of the dotNET ecosystem,
touching on a few tangent topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recording is in Italian and is available below here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough be the first guest for the shiny new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.talkpythontome.com&#34;&gt;Talk Python To Me Podcast&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Michael Kennedy. In this episode we talk about Eve an my other open source releases, which gives us an excuse to touch on a variety of topics such as Polyglot Programming, New Microsoft and the .NET evolution, MongoDB and the Open Source eco-system as seen from the point of view of an old fart who has been spending most of his career in closed systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
