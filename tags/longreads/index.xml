      <title>On the incredible opportunities offered by Starship</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Space-junkie me is back, this time reading about the innumerable opportunities
that SpaceX&amp;rsquo;s Starship will offer once it becomes operational, hopefully no
later than this year or the next. In his &lt;a href=&#34;https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/11/17/science-upside-for-starship/&#34;&gt;Science Upside for Starship&lt;/a&gt;, the
exceptionally knowledgeable Casey Handmer makes a case for Starship relevance
in the future of space exploration by listing an astounding number of
reasonable use-cases for the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is relatively straightforward to think of cool things to do with
SpaceX Starships, so recent posts have focused on trying to understand the
more mixed consequences for incumbent industrial organizations that are not
ideally positioned to exploit the coming advances. It is, however, a fun
exercise to enumerate all the ways in which Starship and related technologies
can help execute bold, ambitious missions of scientific discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It&rsquo;s long-form, yes, but well worth it. Oh, and while you&rsquo;re at it, you might
as well read <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/10/28/starship-is-still-not-understood/">Starship is Still Not Understood</a>, Casey&rsquo;s previous article on the

      <title>The posthuman dog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flo, our dog, spent her whole fifteen-years long life with us. Many, many times
after she passed away, I wondered if she lived a happy dog life or not. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://aeon.co/essays/who-could-dogs-become-without-humans-in-their-lives&#34;&gt;The
posthuman dog&lt;/a&gt; (Aeon), Jessica Pierce poses a fascinating question that
somehow helps find answers to my troubling question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If humans were to disappear from the face of the Earth, what might dogs
become? And would they be better off without us?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Unfortunately, the answer I can infer from the article is not very pleasant to
my guilt.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Terrific piece by Jonathan Zittrain, on The Atlantic, on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/&#34;&gt;link rot and digital
preservation&lt;/a&gt;. I love how well documented and informative it is. Yet, it
remains perfectly approachable for both the non-knowledgeable reader and the
technically savvy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much has been lost already. The glue that holds humanity’s knowledge
together is coming undone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need more content like this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the CEO and founder of Signal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend&amp;rsquo;s reading list also included &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/26/taking-back-our-privacy&#34;&gt;Taking Back Our Privacy&lt;/a&gt;, yet
another&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; New Yorker piece but this time signed by Anna Wiener. This article is
a long-read on Moxie Marlinspike, co-founder and CEO of Signal. Moxie is
a childhood nickname. That alone signals (pun intended) an original
personality. I mean, how many times have you heard of a CEO going by his
childhood nickname?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed the personal story of Marlinspike, along with that of the ascent of
Signal, is fascinating. I did not know, for example, that in 2013 he met Brian
Acton, founder of WhatsApp. Brian expressed interest in adding end-to-end
encryption into WhatsApp. Then came Facebook&amp;rsquo;s acquisition, and, for obvious
reasons, Signal Protocol never landed into the messaging service. The story was
not over, however:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

another<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> New Yorker piece but this time signed by Anna Wiener. This article is
a long-read on Moxie Marlinspike, co-founder and CEO of Signal. Moxie is
a childhood nickname. That alone signals (pun intended) an original
personality. I mean, how many times have you heard of a CEO going by his
childhood nickname?</p>
<p>Indeed the personal story of Marlinspike, along with that of the ascent of
Signal, is fascinating. I did not know, for example, that in 2013 he met Brian
Acton, founder of WhatsApp. Brian expressed interest in adding end-to-end
encryption into WhatsApp. Then came Facebook&rsquo;s acquisition, and, for obvious
reasons, Signal Protocol never landed into the messaging service. The story was
not over, however:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That year, Acton left Facebook, later attributing his departure to
intractable differences about privacy practices. At the heart of the conflict
was tension with Facebook’s top executives, Sheryl Sandberg and Mark
Zuckerberg, who wanted to extend Facebook’s targeted-ad network to WhatsApp.
End-to-end encryption precluded the collection of message content that would
be valuable to advertisers. In early 2018, Acton and Marlinspike announced
the formation of the Signal Foundation, a nonprofit. Acton, the foundation’s
chairman and sole member, seeded it with a no-interest, fifty-million-dollar
loan.</p></blockquote>
<p>What a plot twist. What&rsquo;s even more remarkable is Moxie&rsquo;s personal biography.
He is not your average startup co-founder, not by any mean. He kind stands at
the interconnection between activism, ethical hacking, and anarchy, and yet
he&rsquo;s the CEO of a booming startup.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, my Sunday long-reading list included New Yorker&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-activists-who-embrace-nuclear-power&#34;&gt;The Activists Who
Embrace Nuclear Power&lt;/a&gt; by Rebecca Tuhus-Dubrow. Can nuclear power possibly
be a viable solution for climate change? Twenty or even ten years ago, my
answer would have been a big fat No. Today? Not so sure anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the looming disruptions of climate change have altered the risk
calculus around nuclear energy. James Hansen, the NASA scientist credited
with first bringing global warming to public attention, in 1988, has long
advocated a vast expansion of nuclear power to replace fossil fuels. Even
some environmental groups that have reservations about nuclear energy [&amp;hellip;]
have recognized that abruptly closing existing reactors would lead to a spike
in emissions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I am surprised that the author, who clearly researched the topic well, did not
mention Bill Gates&rsquo; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2020/08/31/bill-gates-nuclear-firm-says-new-reactor-can-backstop-grid-with-molten-salt-storage/">Mini-Reactors</a> approach to the problem. It might have
been a deliberate choice, as at some point, she does note that &ldquo;scientists are
working on smaller, more nimble nuclear reactors.&rdquo;</p>
