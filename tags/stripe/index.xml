      <description>Stripe docs are a marvel, and every developer who&amp;rsquo;s had to deal with them knows it. After years of painful PayPal interactions, I remember the amazement and the feverish grin on my face the first time I landed on their API reference. Stripe API is beautifully designed, but it&amp;rsquo;s the combination of good design and excellent documentation that paved Stripe&amp;rsquo;s fulgid success.

it. After years of painful PayPal interactions, I remember the amazement and
the feverish grin on my face the first time I landed on their API reference.
Stripe API is beautifully designed, but it&rsquo;s the combination of good design and
excellent documentation that paved Stripe&rsquo;s fulgid success.</p>
<p>A few days ago, they unexpectedly released <a href="https://markdoc.io/">MarkDoc</a>, the &ldquo;powerful,
flexible, Markdown-based authoring framework&rdquo; they use internally to build
their documentation. I skimmed through it only rapidly and, unsurprisingly, got
a great first impression.</p>
<p>Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti, who <a href="https://passo.uno/about">knows better than me about docs</a>, published
a solid first-glance <a href="https://passo.uno/markdoc-review/">review of MarkDoc</a> that I think is worth reading.
Spoiler alert, I&rsquo;m quoting below his excellent closing thoughts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The secret to Stripe docs does not lie in superior tooling or magical markup
variants: rather, the reason for their success must be found in the quality
of their docs team, whose information architecture needs caused Markdoc to
happen. This is the kind of magic that happens when you provide enough
technical resources to your technical writers and trust them to do the right
thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Update</em>: MarkDoc even received <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/05/19/markdoc">John Gruber&rsquo;s endorsement</a>. That&rsquo;s quite an
achievement as Gruber is renowned for dismissing most Markdown extensions.</p>
