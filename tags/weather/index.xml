      <description>&lt;p&gt;Simon Collison in &lt;a href=&#34;https://colly.com/journal/another-week-in-edale&#34;&gt;Another Week in Edale&lt;/a&gt; perfectly captures why I enjoy hiking in bad weather, something those in my proximity consider borderline reckless:&lt;/p&gt;

<blockquote>
<p>When I was young I saw only what I wanted to see — mostly myself — in what appeared to be a beautiful landscape with the occasional thrill of the sublime. But now, I see every sign of intensive land management; little is natural or truly wild when almost every hectare is the product of either sheep farming, grouse production, or forestry. And I think about issues of ownership, class, exclusion, climate and tourism. This landscape is political, and it reflects all of us.</p></blockquote>
