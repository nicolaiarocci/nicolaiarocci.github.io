      <description>In a brigh Sunday morning, we went on a lonely beach walk
Our third kid turned eighteen yesterday; she&amp;rsquo;s an adult now, and we&amp;rsquo;re left with no teenagers in our family. She is on a celebrative short trip to Barcelona so we are alone at home, for the first time. It&amp;rsquo;s only temporary, but it&amp;rsquo;ll become the norm in just over a year when she leaves for University. What a strange feeling; the nest is going to be empty soon.</description>

It&rsquo;s only temporary, but it&rsquo;ll become the norm in just over a year when she leaves for University. What a strange feeling; the nest is going to be empty soon. It will take a while before we get used to it.</p>
