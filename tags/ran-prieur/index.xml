&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a common belief that suffering is necessary for pleasure, or that evil is necessary for good, like the change of the seasons. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those ideas that sounds like wisdom, but when you think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s not actually true. There are some people who are happy all the time, and other people who are miserable all the time. I think suffering and evil are like taking a wrong turn on a journey. Taking a wrong turn sometimes happens, and some good can come of it. But it&amp;rsquo;s never necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
