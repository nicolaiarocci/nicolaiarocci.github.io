      <description>If you understand Italian, the recording of my Playwright session at UGIdotNET&amp;rsquo;s [WebDay 2022][1] is now available on YouTube[^2]. Playwright is a phenomenal cross-browser, cross-platform, cross-language, single-API, mobile-friendly front-end testing tool.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to giving the same session in English sooner or later, but I should first win my laziness and start looking for exciting events with open CFPs. If you happen to know one, please let me know.</description>
