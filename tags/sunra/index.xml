      <description>Pitchfork has a great piece on Sun Ra and his legacy. It&amp;rsquo;s worth reading if you&amp;rsquo;re a fan, even more so if you know nothing about him.

He was a visual reassurance of the presence of another world. He brought the cosmos to the streets, and, most importantly, he was a reminder that one does not have to subscribe to the status quo—musically, stylistically, politically, ideologically.</description>
