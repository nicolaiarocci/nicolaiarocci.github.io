      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the historic Dahomey Amazons and founded by three of the biggest powerhouses in African music, Mamani Keïta, Mariam Doumbia, and Oumou Sangare, Les Amazones d&amp;rsquo;Afrique have been using their voices to advocate for women&amp;rsquo;s rights since their 2017 debut. The group has never shied away from mashing up tradition and technology. Still, on Musow Dance, with the endlessly inventive production of Jacknife Lee, they lean heavily into an almost entirely electronic sound, turning up the energy several notches with booming 808s, dramatic synth slides, and bursts of vintage disco. But none of these additions ever overshadow the true soul of the music, instead amplifying the already formidable voices of Les Amazones d&amp;rsquo;Afrique&amp;rsquo;s ever-evolving lineup (&lt;a href=&#34;https://daily.bandcamp.com/best-of-2024/the-best-albums-of-2024-g-m&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><a href="https://lesamazonesdafrique.bandcamp.com/album/musow-danse">Musow Dance</a> is a stunning release, and Kuma Fo is just the perfect leading track. Every component is on point, finely dispensed and precisely interleaved: voices, sound, beat, you name it. The producer, after all, is Jacknife Lee (R.E.M., Taylor Swift, U2.)</p>

<p>Then, there are the lyrics with their meaninful message. While they all sing in their native language (the four members are from different African countries), I could dig out the English translation from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHeC03169e4">official video</a>, which is equally good and powerful.</p>
<p>She preserves life, gives the first breath<br>
She preserves life, gives the first breath<br>
Woman oh, oh woman<br>
She gives the first breath</p>
<p>Chorus:<br>
Whatever they say<br>
Whatever women have to say<br>
Is worth listening to<br>
Life is hard, I fight with courage, let me be<br>
Whatever they say<br>
Whatever women have to say<br>
Is worth listening to<br>
You know, my life is mine, so give me space</p>
<p>The world was created by a woman<br>
Mika mika mika mika mika<br>
She preserves life<br>
Mika mika mika mika mika</p>
<p>You wonder how we’re gona make it?<br>
We decided to gather our strength and fight<br>
Whatever it costs<br>
You wonder how we’ll make it?</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>You light up life<br>
You light up life<br>
To educate a woman is to educate a village<br>
To educate a girl is to educate the world<br>
Get up, get up, get up<br>
Regain your feminine strength<br>
Woman, woman, woman, get up, get up<br>
Regain your feminine strength</p>
<p>I travelled to the North<br>
People from the North told me<br>
That women have dignity<br>
I travelled to the West<br>
People from the West told me<br>
That women have dignity</p>
<p>I belong to myself, I’m free to do what I like<br>
I will not accept what others want me to be<br>
I belong to myself, I’m free to do what I like<br>
I will never accept it anymore</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>Whatever they say<br>
Whatever women have to say<br>
Is worth listening to<br>
I will not be driven like a car<br>
Woman, woman, woman</p>
<p>You give hope<br>
You give hope<br>
You give hope<br>
You give life<br>
To educate a woman is to educate a village<br>
To educate a girl is to educate the world</p>
