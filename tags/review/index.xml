      <description>Thanks to Giovanni Ansaldo&amp;rsquo;s convincing review on yesterday&amp;rsquo;s issue of Il Mondo podcast, my first Bandcamp purchase1 is the recently released Astral Gold album by Dean McPhee, a British guitarist who combines folk with experimental music and jazz using his telecaster guitar to create endless landscapes.
As the title suggests, McPhee&amp;rsquo;s latest album is a journey into outer space. The album consists of six instrumental pieces, all captivating, enjoyable, and cohesive; they all serve as each other&amp;rsquo;s natural continuation.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to Giovanni Ansaldo&rsquo;s convincing review on yesterday&rsquo;s issue of
<a href="https://www.internazionale.it/ilmondo">Il Mondo</a> podcast, my first Bandcamp
purchase<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is the recently released Astral Gold album by Dean McPhee, a
British guitarist who combines folk with experimental music and jazz using his
telecaster guitar to create endless landscapes.</p>
<p>As the title suggests, McPhee&rsquo;s latest album is a journey into outer space. The
album consists of six instrumental pieces, all captivating, enjoyable, and
cohesive; they all serve as each other&rsquo;s natural continuation. Along with the
sound of his guitar, the musician uses tape loops, small percussion sounds, and
a few synthesizers here and there. The result is a hypnotic moonscape
reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The album avoids easy psychedelia and opts for a more meditative approach while
meeting expectations perfectly. Sometimes, it sounds like Brian Eno&rsquo;s early
ambient phase and the more dilated Tangerine Dream. Dean McPhee has created an
otherworldly experience with just a few elements; minimalism is key.</p>

<p>Look <a href="/sick-and-tired-of-spotifys-music-consuming-model/">here</a> for my
recent Spotify tirade and how I decided to return to purchased music.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>On a lateral note, this music would fit perfectly as an EVE Online
soundtrack. I vividly remember my space pirate days in that game, exploring far
away and unknown solar systems, looking for prey while listening to JÃ³n Hallur Haraldsson&rsquo;s
incredibly immersive <a href="https://archive.org/details/eve-online-soundtrack">original
soundtrack</a> (McPhee is on
another level, and the two genres don&rsquo;t compare, but hey.)&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
