      <title>rsync with a different user</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned how to rsync with a user different than the one connected to the remote. Why would one want to do such a
thing? The data I need to download from that server is owned by &amp;lsquo;backup,&amp;rsquo; a different, service-only user. I wanted to
avoid going the change-permissions slippery route and allow my user direct access to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the rsync documentation, I learned about the nifty &lt;code&gt;--rsync-path=PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1#opt--rsync-path&#34;&gt;option&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I learned how to rsync with a user different than the one connected to the remote. Why would one want to do such a
thing? The data I need to download from that server is owned by &lsquo;backup,&rsquo; a different, service-only user. I wanted to
avoid going the change-permissions slippery route and allow my user direct access to the data.</p>
<p>Looking at the rsync documentation, I learned about the nifty <code>--rsync-path=PROGRAM</code> <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1#opt--rsync-path">option</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use this to specify what program is to be run on the remote machine to start-up rsync. Often used when rsync is not in
the default remote-shell&rsquo;s path (e.g. &ndash;rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync).</p></blockquote>
<p>The example caught my attention. I could perhaps leverage this option to perform a user switch before executing rsync
(now performed on the remote machine). As further research confirmed, it <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/546296">can be done</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>rsync --rsync-path &#39;sudo -u backup rsync&#39; -a --delete host:source destination
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It didn&rsquo;t work immediately because my user was not a sudoer, but that was an easy fix:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>cat &gt; /etc/sudoers.d/myuser &lt;&lt; EOF
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>myuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/rsync
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>EOF
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you can see, not only must the user be a sudoer, but it also needs to be able to sudo with no password. One last
minor issue was that &lsquo;backup&rsquo;, being a service user, had no shell access. That was another easy fix:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo usermod -s /bin/bash backup
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now my rsync-with-a-different-user command works like a charm. I do have some mild security concerns, though. My user is
a sudoer (can only sudo rsync, though<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), and &lsquo;backup&rsquo; now has shell access. As password logins are turned off, and
SSH keys-only access is allowed to the machine (and I&rsquo;m the only person holding those keys), everything&rsquo;s still
reasonably safe. Are there better ways? Please let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sebastian on Mastodon for <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@DarkMetatron@rollenspiel.social/110939139075153024">pointing out</a> that I should limit the sudoer to just rsync itself. I updated the post accordingly. By the way, this is why I love posting TILs in public.
