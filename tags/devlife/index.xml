      <description>Tomorrow we&amp;rsquo;re releasing a major project on which we&amp;rsquo;ve been working non-stop for two and a half years. No matter how many years in the trenches, release day always makes me a bit nervous. Experience does help. I know there will be problems, and we will solve them. Some customers will complain, and those will be the most vocal. The vast majority of them will appreciate the effort, enjoy the features, and stay silent.</description>

for two and a half years. No matter how many years in the trenches, release day
always makes me a bit nervous. Experience does help. I know there will be
problems, and we will solve them. Some customers will complain, and those will
be the most vocal. The vast majority of them will appreciate the effort, enjoy
the features, and stay silent. That&rsquo;s how it works. We&rsquo;ll do just fine.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, it&rsquo;s a working weekend for me. While hacking in the early
morning, I listened to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1WjnPw3PbQJOsEpEgJsz5f?si=53a83f9c31484310">The Mildlife Very Fantastic Playlist</a> when a curious
tune caught my attention<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I glanced over to Spotify, and my eyes fell on
the most appropriate CD cover for launch day ever.</p>

<p>Whatever happens tomorrow, lay back and keep smiling.</p>
