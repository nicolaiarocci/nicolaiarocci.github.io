      <description>Two years after its launch, Kagi, the pay-per-use search engine is profitable.
We are also thrilled to report that we have achieved profitability. This significant milestone is a testament to our sustainable growth and fiscal responsibility. It demonstrates that our approach of offering a premium, ad-free search experience resonates with users who support a service aligning with their values. Becoming profitable allows us to reinvest in the business, further enhancing our offerings and ensuring that we can continue to provide a top-notch search experience.</description>

<p>This is a remarkable achievement. Two years ago, only a few would have bet on
its sustainability. I&rsquo;ve tried Kagi&rsquo;s free tier with good results, but not as
much as I would like. It&rsquo;s not my default search engineâ€”not yet, at least.</p>
<p>Over time, I&rsquo;ve switched from free (as in &ldquo;you, the user, are the product we
sell&rdquo;) to paid services. Years ago, I dropped Gmail and switched to Fastmail,
and I could never imagine going back. I&rsquo;m good with paying for excellent
critical services. My data and I are not the product, and I&rsquo;m invested in them
staying around long-term.</p>
