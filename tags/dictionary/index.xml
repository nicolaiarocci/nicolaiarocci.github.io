      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2014, James Somers sat down to write a beautiful, entertaining lament about
the state of today’s dictionaries and an argument in favor of the adoption of
Noah Webster’s 1913 edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want you to conclude that it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes,
Webster&amp;rsquo;s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. They&amp;rsquo;re so much
better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm&amp;rsquo;s
length from the actual language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2014, James Somers sat down to write a beautiful, entertaining lament about
the state of today’s dictionaries and an argument in favor of the adoption of
Noah Webster’s 1913 edition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to conclude that it&rsquo;s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes,
Webster&rsquo;s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. They&rsquo;re so much
better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm&rsquo;s
length from the actual language.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Recall that the New Oxford, for the word &ldquo;fustian,&rdquo; gives &ldquo;pompous or
pretentious speech or writing.&rdquo; I said earlier that that wasn&rsquo;t even really
correct. Here, then, is Webster&rsquo;s definition: &ldquo;An inflated style of writing;
a kind of writing in which high-sounding words are used, above the dignity of
the thoughts or subject; bombast.&rdquo; Do you see the difference? What makes
fustian fustian is not just that the language is pompous—it&rsquo;s that this
pomposity is above the dignity of the thoughts or subject. It&rsquo;s using fancy
language where fancy language isn&rsquo;t called for. It&rsquo;s a subtle difference, but
that&rsquo;s the whole point: English is an awfully subtle instrument. A dictionary
that ignores these little shades is dangerous; in fact in those cases it&rsquo;s
worse than useless. It&rsquo;s misleading, deflating. It divests those words of their
worth and purpose.</p></blockquote>

time..</p>
<p>Not happy with the essay alone, he also added instructions on installing
Webster&rsquo;s on a Mac. Unfortunately, I could not get them to work on Catalina:
the DictUnifier app would crash as soon as I dragged the [dictionary file][4]
on it. A little research revealed that DictUnifier has a [problem with
Catalina][2]. The suggested workarounds did not work for me. In the process,
I learned that DictUnifier has gone unmaintained. Thankfully, a couple of years
ago a good soul released [DictConv][3], a &ldquo;Node.js version of DictUnifier&rdquo;.
DictConv did the trick. Webster&rsquo;s 1913 is now happily residing in my macOS
Dictionary.</p>
