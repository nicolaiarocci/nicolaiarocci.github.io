      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just came across this tweet by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/levie/status/1763356362858430501&#34;&gt;Aaron Levie&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best founders I know — no matter their company’s scale — thrive on doing
customer support directly. There’s literally no better way to understand the
pulse of your customer base, what features to build next, or where systems are
breaking down. It’s always upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It profoundly resonates with me. For context, we&amp;rsquo;ve been a small company in the
market since 1991, making us quite the rare bird (we have seen so many software
companies come and go that it is unbelievable).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It profoundly resonates with me. For context, we&rsquo;ve been a small company in the
market since 1991, making us quite the rare bird (we have seen so many software
companies come and go that it is unbelievable).</p>
<p>My untiring co-founder, Stefano, still does customer support daily, while I
chime in occasionally when needed. Every Friday at 2.30 pm, our dev and support
teams have a joint call to assess what&rsquo;s going on on the frontline, to get the
pulse and to check if there are new and unexpected issues the customers are
experiencing with our products. This call is complimentary to the live chat that
both teams share daily. This continuous feedback cycle and the resulting quick
release cycle have been the key that allowed us to stay relevant and endure for
such a long time.</p>
<p>Of course, founders doing customer support delays other fundamental
activities, and sometimes that&rsquo;s stressful, but it is worth it.</p>
