      <description>&lt;p&gt;I deleted my Bluesky account. I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow anyone anyway, and I only used it to repost content from my website. Being almost mainstream now, I found Bluesky to have the same dynamics as other mass-adopted social networks: controversies, lots of ego-hunting, vanity fairs, sterile debates, witticisms, and everything else that doesn&amp;rsquo;t interest me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having left Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/im-leaving-twitter/x/&#34;&gt;a while ago&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook a long time before that, I&amp;rsquo;m left with &lt;a href=&#34;https://fosstodon.org/@nicola&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; precisely because there are fewer people there, and they are more in my niche; it feels like the pre-mass social media world, like the first Twitter years. Not coincidentally, I&amp;rsquo;m also receiving more feedback on my content than anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Having left Twitter <a href="http://localhost:1313/im-leaving-twitter/x/">a while ago</a> and Facebook a long time before that, I&rsquo;m left with <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@nicola">Mastodon</a> precisely because there are fewer people there, and they are more in my niche; it feels like the pre-mass social media world, like the first Twitter years. Not coincidentally, I&rsquo;m also receiving more feedback on my content than anywhere else.</p>
<p>I doubt I&rsquo;ll get back into social networks; they failed me hard. I get all my news from RSS anyway, where I can select the sources, and there&rsquo;s no algorithm dictating the agenda.</p>
