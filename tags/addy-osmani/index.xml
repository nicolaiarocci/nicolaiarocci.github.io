&lt;p&gt;Writing forces clarity. When I explain a concept to others - in a doc, a talk, a code review comment, even just chatting with AI - I discover the gaps in my own understanding. The act of making something legible to someone else makes it more legible to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Addy Osmani in &lt;a href=&#34;https://addyosmani.com/blog/21-lessons/&#34;&gt;21 Lessons From 14 Years at Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one quoted above is #12, and I’ve been religiously abiding by it for a long time, but all 21 are well worth reading. If you&amp;rsquo;ve been in software engineering long enough, they’ll resonate with you. Also, most lessons apply to all kinds of career paths, not just software.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
