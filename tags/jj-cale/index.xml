      <description>&lt;p&gt;We watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Private_Life&#34;&gt;A Private Life&lt;/a&gt; in the theatre yesterday, a fine, funny and intriguing French film set in Paris with a solid Jodie Foster as protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m here for the closing piece of the soundtrack, the one you hear over the end credits: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.last.fm/music/J.J.+Cale/_/Don%27t+Go+To+Strangers&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Go To Strangers&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Cale&#34;&gt;JJ Cale&lt;/a&gt;. I immediately reached for Shazam while Serena looked it up on Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m spending this whole Sunday morning listening and reading about the artist and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_sound&#34;&gt;Tulsa sound&lt;/a&gt; movement he originated. Despite his reticence and all-around low profile, he was no small feat and inspired many a great artist in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Just to get your bearings, he&amp;rsquo;s the original author of Cocaine later brought to fame by Eric Clapton.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Funny how you go to watch a 2025 French movie only to end up digging an American artist from the 70s.</p>
