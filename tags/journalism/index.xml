      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kara Swisher, a dean in digital and classical journalism, has an interesting article in the New York Magazine. As a witness and protagonist she recounts how in the last 30 years digital has eaten away at traditional media and how today, with the advent of AI, there is a risk of it happening all over again. Above all, she reasons why it is essential for journalists not to surrender their weapons and lawmakers to step in and finally harness an industry that always had free reign and no regulation, as it is considered inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] more and more people across the globe get their news and cues from social media. It has a scary ability to generate anxiety and rage, and it is addictive. Expert after expert I’ve talked to over the years has made the same point — in the new paradigm, engagement equals enragement. This is made worse by the people who run these companies, for whom anticipation of consequences is lacking and whose first instinct is to let it all through the gate, regardless of potential damage or danger. What’s the opposite of the mommy state? Parent-free chaos.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read her article <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/kara-swisher-burn-book-excerpt-silicon-valley-media.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I appreciate how Swisher was an initial proponent of digital advent, so much so that she <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Digital">co-founded All Things Digital</a>. Yet, that didn&rsquo;t prevent her from foreseeing the troubled waters ahead.</p>
