      <description>Yesterday I gave a talk at FOSDEM 2014 in Brussels. The conference itself was amazing, with over 5000 attendees literally swarming and taking over the ULB Campus. I was stoked at how smoothly everything was going on despite the incredible number of simultaneous sessions and the number of attendees continuouslyÂ flowing between buildings and conference rooms. Everybody involved, volunteers and attendees, has been very welcoming, charming and helpful. In short, I had a blast.</description>
