      <description>&lt;p&gt;… and a Great Person in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathy is your most important skill. Practice it with everyone you interact with, and everyone who interacts with your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility goes hand in hand with empathy. Be open to the possibility (likelihood, even) that you are wrong. Know that you will always be learning and improving. accept and own up to mistakes immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The less you fear being wrong, the more confident you can be. You are wrong about many things. You know very little about most things. Everyone else is exactly the same way. Embrace it. Always learn, always question, always adapt and grow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
