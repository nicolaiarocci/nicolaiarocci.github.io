      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/fairy-tales/&#34;&gt;Robin Rendle&lt;/a&gt; quoting Neil Gaiman, who is quoting G.K. Chesterton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairy tales, as G.K. Chesterton once said, are more than true. Not because
they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be
defeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Literary&#34;&gt;somewhere&lt;/a&gt; that he based the Gilbert character from &lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt;
on Chesterton, so it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise to find Gaiman quoting Chesterton in &lt;em&gt;Smoke
and Mirrors&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanting to find the work in which the quote first appeared, I did
a little research only to discover that G.K. Chesterton never actually wrote
it. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://alleysiande.com/random-thoughts/gk-chesterton-an-actual-quote&#34;&gt;E.M. Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Gaiman&amp;rsquo;s is a rework of the following
original quote:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/fairy-tales/">Robin Rendle</a> quoting Neil Gaiman, who is quoting G.K. Chesterton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fairy tales, as G.K. Chesterton once said, are more than true. Not because
they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be
defeated.</p></blockquote>
<p>I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Literary">somewhere</a> that he based the Gilbert character from <em>The Sandman</em>
on Chesterton, so it&rsquo;s no surprise to find Gaiman quoting Chesterton in <em>Smoke
and Mirrors</em>.</p>
<p>Wanting to find the work in which the quote first appeared, I did
a little research only to discover that G.K. Chesterton never actually wrote
it. According to <a href="https://alleysiande.com/random-thoughts/gk-chesterton-an-actual-quote">E.M. Goldsmith</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, Gaiman&rsquo;s is a rework of the following
original quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fairy Tales then, are not responsible for producing in children fear, or any
of the shapes of fear; fairy tales do not give the child the idea of the evil
or the ugly; that is in the child already, because it is in the world
already. <strong>Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What
fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of
bogey</strong>. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an
imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the
dragon. Exactly what the fairy tale does is this: it accustoms him to
a series of clear pictures of <strong>the idea that these limitless terrors had
a limit, that these shapeless enemies have enemies in the knights of God,
that there is something in the universe more mystical than darkness, and
stronger than strong fear.</strong> &ndash;Tremendous Trifles (1909), XVII: &ldquo;The Red
Angel&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>An excellently simplified, actualized and de-Christianized rework, I&rsquo;d say.  On
the subject of fairy tales, E.M. Goldsmith has another quote that is worth
sharing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we step into the family, by the act of being born, we do step into
a world which is incalculable, into a world which has its own strange laws,
into a world which could do without us, into a world we have not made. In
other words, when we step into the family we step into a fairy-tale.&quot;
â€“Heretics, CW, I, p.143 G.K. Chesterton.</p></blockquote>
<p>What great of a writer Chesterton was. No wonder Jorge Luis Borges and J.R.R.
Tolkien were some of his great estimators. On Chesterton, Borges supposedly<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
said: &ldquo;Literature is one of the forms of happiness; perhaps no writer has given
me as many happy hours as Chesterton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Along with many others on the Internet, E.M. Goldsmith attributes the simplified quote to the popular TV show <em>Criminal Minds</em>. It&rsquo;d be interesting to find who quoted who here.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
