      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re doing a DevRomagna meetup this month, and I think it will be a super-interesting one. It&amp;rsquo;s titled Heading to Go: A Look at Building a Video Encoder and the presenter will be Daniel Enrico Botta, a C# software engineer who recently switched to Go for his video encoding projects. Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:
This talk will discuss the experience of moving from C# to Go for a video coding project. The pros and cons of using Go, a modern and efficient programming language, and how it compares to other languages will be shown.</description>

      <title>In-person vs. online events</title>

      <description>Last week, thanks to Andrea Verlicchi1&amp;rsquo;s effort, we ran the first in-person DevRomagna event since 2019. We did some meetups during the pandemic, some in 2020 and a couple in 2022, but they were all online.
In theory, online meetups and DevRomagna are a match made in heaven. The Romagna region consists of small same-size towns scattered in the vast countryside. To accommodate this, and in an attempt to encourage varied participation, DevRomagna has always been a roaming meetup.</description>
