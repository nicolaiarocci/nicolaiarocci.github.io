      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been slacking a little lately, shocked mainly by what is happening
worldwide. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been busy at work and, unfortunately, am taking my old man
to way too many medical checkups. A short recap of notable facts might be in
order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nuget.org/packages/FatturaElettronica/3.6.0&#34;&gt;FatturaElettronica for .NET 3.6&lt;/a&gt; has been released. It adds support for the upcoming technical specifications v1.9 that are coming into effect on April 1, 2025 (not a joke.) The changelog is &lt;a href=&#34;https://fatturaelettronicaopensource.org/docs/changelog.html#v-360&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did some maintenance work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://python-eve.org&#34;&gt;Eve&lt;/a&gt;. The CI workflow has been switched to &lt;code&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;20.04&lt;/code&gt;, as the latter is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/11101&#34;&gt;about to be sunsetted&lt;/a&gt; by GitHub. I also merged two pull requests (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1541&#34;&gt;#1541&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1547&#34;&gt;#1547&lt;/a&gt;), one of which was long-standing. There isn&amp;rsquo;t enough material for a release, although the guys who submitted the PRs might think otherwise (if that&amp;rsquo;s the case, let me know.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ran two &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/devromagna/&#34;&gt;DevRomagna&lt;/a&gt; meetups. The first one was on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/devromagna/events/304417824/&#34;&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; and was kept by Alessandro Mengoli, of whom I&amp;rsquo;m very proud (I&amp;rsquo;ve been encouraging him to start speaking for a long time.) The second was on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/devromagna/events/305974494/?eventOrigin=group_past_events&#34;&gt;Linux Containers&lt;/a&gt; but before Docker. The speaker was Gabriele Santomaggio, my go-to buddy regarding low-level networking stuff. I found both events to be quite successful and enjoyable. I hope the other attendants agree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally deactivated my Twitter/X account. I abandoned the platform a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/im-leaving-twitter/x/&#34;&gt;while ago&lt;/a&gt; and did not miss it. I maintain a presence on Mastodon and Bluesky, mainly to propagate whatever content I post on my website, but don&amp;rsquo;t count on me following or reading you there (same with LinkedIn.) I&amp;rsquo;m not active on social media and don&amp;rsquo;t see myself getting back into them. I&amp;rsquo;m not interested anymore (and the content there is mostly trash.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went on &lt;a href=&#34;https://out.ac/IPUdpG&#34;&gt;a nice hike&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago. It was cold and overcast, and that&amp;rsquo;s why, I suspect, I did not meet a single person the whole day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of hiking, I finally got myself a Garmin inReach device. It&amp;rsquo;s meant to be used in case of emergency. It allows me to call for help  and send sms messages even when no cell signal is available (it uses the Iridium satellite network.) I resisted getting it so far because of the high cost, not so much of the device itself, but the mandatory subscription. Only &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Hv7cH_oShbw?si=KTYHBBuR5frjJMxU&#34;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt;, I found that one can buy Garmin data plans from other vendors, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protegear.de/en-gb/inreach-dataplans&#34;&gt;ProteGear&lt;/a&gt; has a nice option to suspend the subscription when not in use. So, I bought the device from Garmin, activated it, and subscribed to ProteGear. It&amp;rsquo;s looking good so far, and sending sms messages (and emails!) when there&amp;rsquo;s no cell signal feels like black magic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/books-i-have-read&#34;&gt;good books&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, my dad is not doing well. He&amp;rsquo;s okay now, but he&amp;rsquo;s been going through a lot, and more is expected soon. That&amp;rsquo;s life, I know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am having difficulty making peace with what is happening in the world right now. American friends, I cannot understand how you could re-elect Donald Trump for a second term. It beats me. I am in shock and worried about the geopolitical consequences. I hope time will prove me wrong, but the future looks grim.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re doing a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/devromagna/events/291027334/&#34;&gt;DevRomagna meetup&lt;/a&gt; this month, and I think it will be a
super-interesting one. It&amp;rsquo;s titled &lt;em&gt;Heading to Go: A Look at Building a Video
Encoder&lt;/em&gt; and the presenter will be Daniel Enrico Botta, a C# software engineer
who recently switched to Go for his video encoding projects. Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the experience of moving from C# to Go for a video
coding project. The pros and cons of using Go, a modern and efficient
programming language, and how it compares to other languages will be shown.
In addition, the use of FFmpeg, an open-source tool for video encoding, and
how it was used to create the video encoder will be discussed. Advice will be
given on using Go and Ffmpeg for future projects. Together, the benefits of
using these tools for video encoding will be understood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

super-interesting one. It&rsquo;s titled <em>Heading to Go: A Look at Building a Video

who recently switched to Go for his video encoding projects. Here&rsquo;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This talk will discuss the experience of moving from C# to Go for a video

<p>Like me, Daniel has a C# background, so it will be interesting to see the whys
and hows he picked Golang for his video encoding work. I&rsquo;m curious about his
perspective on both languages and what he learned from adopting a new stack.
Leaving the safe path to adventure into unknown territory is a safe way to
broaden knowledge and improve self-confidence, or at least it was for me when I
added Python to my tool belt. In surprising and unexpected ways, most of the
new expertise also proved invaluable in my C# &amp; F# work.</p>
<p>The session will be held in person, in Italian. So if you&rsquo;re interested, j<a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/devromagna/events/291027334/">oin us</a>!</p>

      <title>In-person vs. online events</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/in-person-vs.-online-events/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 07:05:25 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/in-person-vs.-online-events/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/verlok&#34;&gt;Andrea Verlicchi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rsquo;s effort, we ran the first
in-person &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/DevRomagna/&#34;&gt;DevRomagna&lt;/a&gt; event since 2019. We did some meetups during the
pandemic, some in 2020 and a couple in 2022, but they were all online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, online meetups and DevRomagna are a match made in heaven. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romagna&#34;&gt;Romagna region&lt;/a&gt; consists of small same-size towns scattered in the vast
countryside. To accommodate this, and in an attempt to encourage varied
participation, DevRomagna has always been a roaming meetup. We might be in one
place one month, and then, next month, we will likely move to another town.
With online meetups, attendance doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to commit to a commute saving
time and money and allowing everyone to participate in events that would
otherwise be too far away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/verlok">Andrea Verlicchi</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>&rsquo;s effort, we ran the first
in-person <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/DevRomagna/">DevRomagna</a> event since 2019. We did some meetups during the
pandemic, some in 2020 and a couple in 2022, but they were all online.</p>
<p>In theory, online meetups and DevRomagna are a match made in heaven. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romagna">Romagna region</a> consists of small same-size towns scattered in the vast
countryside. To accommodate this, and in an attempt to encourage varied
participation, DevRomagna has always been a roaming meetup. We might be in one
place one month, and then, next month, we will likely move to another town.
With online meetups, attendance doesn&rsquo;t have to commit to a commute saving
time and money and allowing everyone to participate in events that would
otherwise be too far away.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s value in commitment. The other day, we gathered in a new cozy
venue (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/centro.vaina">Ca&rsquo; Vaina</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, a municipality-run youth center and coworking space)
where my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/gsantomaggio">Gabriele Santomaggio</a> talked about Kubernetes, service mesh
and isolation techniques he and his colleagues adopt at Vmware. After the talk,
some of us went for dinner in a nearby pizzeria. The pizza was good, and the
craft beer was great. We talked about many things like our jobs, our favorite
developer tools and languages, and all the nerdy stuff you&rsquo;d imagine.
Suggestions for new original presentations were thrown around, which is always
good. Most importantly, I got to know new people, including Ugo, a fellow
<a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/">Microsoft MVP</a> from my area whom I somehow managed not to meet in all these
years. With Ugo, we are now planning a few hopefully engaging dotnet-centered
events.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a pleasant, fruitful evening spent with like-minded
individuals. We could have done an online event with, probably, a higher
attendance. I would&rsquo;ve saved some money and time (Imola, the town where the
meetup took place, is a half-hour drive, which includes a highway toll), but
I wouldn&rsquo;t get to meet Ugo at the table or see Gabriele after two years of
pandemic-inflicted hiatus.</p>
<p>More than one interested in the event asked if we would stream it, and my
answer was no for several reasons. I suspect that in-person attendance would
dwindle if we&rsquo;d stream our events, as we&rsquo;d be effectively discouraging active
participation. Also, it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to the people who make an effort and
come to the venue. Recording the session and streaming them later might be an
option, but this would discourage live participation too. So, for the time
being, whenever possible, DevRomagna will stay true to its roots and remain
a live event. There might be exceptions, like if we have a foreign or far-away
guest or can&rsquo;t find a proper venue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a local meetup, and &ldquo;local&rdquo; hardly conjugates with &ldquo;online.&rdquo;</p>
