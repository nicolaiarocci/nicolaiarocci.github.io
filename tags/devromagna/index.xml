      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re doing a DevRomagna meetup this month, and I think it will be a super-interesting one. It&amp;rsquo;s titled Heading to Go: A Look at Building a Video Encoder and the presenter will be Daniel Enrico Botta, a C# software engineer who recently switched to Go for his video encoding projects. Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:
This talk will discuss the experience of moving from C# to Go for a video coding project. The pros and cons of using Go, a modern and efficient programming language, and how it compares to other languages will be shown.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re doing a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/devromagna/events/291027334/">DevRomagna meetup</a> this month, and I think it will be a
super-interesting one. It&rsquo;s titled <em>Heading to Go: A Look at Building a Video
Encoder</em> and the presenter will be Daniel Enrico Botta, a C# software engineer
who recently switched to Go for his video encoding projects. Here&rsquo;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This talk will discuss the experience of moving from C# to Go for a video
coding project. The pros and cons of using Go, a modern and efficient
programming language, and how it compares to other languages will be shown.
In addition, the use of FFmpeg, an open-source tool for video encoding, and
how it was used to create the video encoder will be discussed. Advice will be
given on using Go and Ffmpeg for future projects. Together, the benefits of
using these tools for video encoding will be understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like me, Daniel has a C# background, so it will be interesting to see the whys
and hows he picked Golang for his video encoding work. I&rsquo;m curious about his
perspective on both languages and what he learned from adopting a new stack.
Leaving the safe path to adventure into unknown territory is a safe way to
broaden knowledge and improve self-confidence, or at least it was for me when I
added Python to my tool belt. In surprising and unexpected ways, most of the
new expertise also proved invaluable in my C# &amp; F# work.</p>
<p>The session will be held in person, in Italian. So if you&rsquo;re interested, j<a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/devromagna/events/291027334/">oin us</a>!</p>

      <title>In-person vs. online events</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/in-person-vs.-online-events/</link>

      <description>Last week, thanks to Andrea Verlicchi1&amp;rsquo;s effort, we ran the first in-person DevRomagna event since 2019. We did some meetups during the pandemic, some in 2020 and a couple in 2022, but they were all online.
In theory, online meetups and DevRomagna are a match made in heaven. The Romagna region consists of small same-size towns scattered in the vast countryside. To accommodate this, and in an attempt to encourage varied participation, DevRomagna has always been a roaming meetup.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/verlok">Andrea Verlicchi</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>&rsquo;s effort, we ran the first
in-person <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/DevRomagna/">DevRomagna</a> event since 2019. We did some meetups during the
pandemic, some in 2020 and a couple in 2022, but they were all online.</p>
<p>In theory, online meetups and DevRomagna are a match made in heaven. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romagna">Romagna region</a> consists of small same-size towns scattered in the vast
countryside. To accommodate this, and in an attempt to encourage varied
participation, DevRomagna has always been a roaming meetup. We might be in one
place one month, and then, next month, we will likely move to another town.
With online meetups, attendance doesn&rsquo;t have to commit to a commute saving
time and money and allowing everyone to participate in events that would
otherwise be too far away.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s value in commitment. The other day, we gathered in a new cozy
venue (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/centro.vaina">Ca&rsquo; Vaina</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, a municipality-run youth center and coworking space)
where my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/gsantomaggio">Gabriele Santomaggio</a> talked about Kubernetes, service mesh
and isolation techniques he and his colleagues adopt at Vmware. After the talk,
some of us went for dinner in a nearby pizzeria. The pizza was good, and the
craft beer was great. We talked about many things like our jobs, our favorite
developer tools and languages, and all the nerdy stuff you&rsquo;d imagine.
Suggestions for new original presentations were thrown around, which is always
good. Most importantly, I got to know new people, including Ugo, a fellow
<a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/">Microsoft MVP</a> from my area whom I somehow managed not to meet in all these
years. With Ugo, we are now planning a few hopefully engaging dotnet-centered
events.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a pleasant, fruitful evening spent with like-minded
individuals. We could have done an online event with, probably, a higher
attendance. I would&rsquo;ve saved some money and time (Imola, the town where the
meetup took place, is a half-hour drive, which includes a highway toll), but
I wouldn&rsquo;t get to meet Ugo at the table or see Gabriele after two years of
pandemic-inflicted hiatus.</p>
<p>More than one interested in the event asked if we would stream it, and my
answer was no for several reasons. I suspect that in-person attendance would
dwindle if we&rsquo;d stream our events, as we&rsquo;d be effectively discouraging active
participation. Also, it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to the people who make an effort and
come to the venue. Recording the session and streaming them later might be an
option, but this would discourage live participation too. So, for the time
being, whenever possible, DevRomagna will stay true to its roots and remain
a live event. There might be exceptions, like if we have a foreign or far-away
guest or can&rsquo;t find a proper venue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a local meetup, and &ldquo;local&rdquo; hardly conjugates with &ldquo;online.&rdquo;</p>
