      <description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Knuth challenged ChatGPT-4 with 20 questions and then submitted the results and his comments to Stephen Wolfram. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/chatGPT20.txt&#34;&gt;whole thing&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating in many ways and worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some remarkable quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course these are extremely impressive responses, sometimes astonishingly so; thus I totally understand why you and
others have been paying attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most immediate impression is the quality of the wordsmithing. It&amp;rsquo;s way better than 99% of copy that people
actually write. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not like a Markov model that uses the most predictable way to continue what&amp;rsquo;s already
been said. On the other hand there are surprising lapses there too, as typical of any large system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/chatGPT20.txt">whole thing</a> is fascinating in many ways and worth reading.</p>
<p>Some remarkable quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course these are extremely impressive responses, sometimes astonishingly so; thus I totally understand why you and
others have been paying attention to it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The most immediate impression is the quality of the wordsmithing. It&rsquo;s way better than 99% of copy that people
actually write. It&rsquo;s definitely not like a Markov model that uses the most predictable way to continue what&rsquo;s already
been said. On the other hand there are surprising lapses there too, as typical of any large system.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer #10 reads as though it&rsquo;s the best answer yet. But it&rsquo;s almost totally wrong!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how the confident tone lends credibility to all of that made-up nonsense. Almost impossible for anybody
without knowledge of the book to believe that those &ldquo;facts&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t authorititative and well researched.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I find it fascinating that novelists galore have written for decades about scenarios that might occur after a
&ldquo;singularity&rdquo; in which superintelligent machines exist. But as far as I know, not a single novelist has realized that
such a singularity would almost surely be preceded by a world in which machines are 0.01% intelligent (say), and in
which millions of real people would be able to interact with them freely at essentially no cost.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I myself shall certainly continue to leave such research to others, and to devote my time to developing concepts that
are authentic and trustworthy. And I hope you do the same.</p></blockquote>
