      <description>Bret Devereaux has long been my go-to source for all things ancient and military history. One thing I somehow missed reading from his incredibly resourceful website is the This Isn&amp;rsquo;t Sparta series.

The whole thing is a very long read, with some installments more engaging than others but overall very enjoyable, eye-opening, and information dense.</description>
