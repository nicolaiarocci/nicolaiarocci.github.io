      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://acoup.blog/&#34;&gt;Bret Devereaux&lt;/a&gt; has long been my go-to source for all things ancient and
military history. One thing I somehow missed reading from his incredibly
resourceful website is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://acoup.blog/2019/08/16/collections-this-isnt-sparta-part-i-spartan-school/&#34;&gt;This Isn&amp;rsquo;t Sparta&lt;/a&gt; series. He recently published
a three-year-anniversary series retrospective which promptly surfaced on my
RSS feed, giving me a chance to catch up over the holidays. The whole thing is
a very long read, with some installments more engaging than others but overall
very enjoyable, eye-opening, and information dense. In the just-published

military history. One thing I somehow missed reading from his incredibly
resourceful website is the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/08/16/collections-this-isnt-sparta-part-i-spartan-school/">This Isn&rsquo;t Sparta</a> series. He recently published
a three-year-anniversary series retrospective which promptly surfaced on my
RSS feed, giving me a chance to catch up over the holidays. The whole thing is
a very long read, with some installments more engaging than others but overall
very enjoyable, eye-opening, and information dense. In the just-published
retrospective, Bret writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The series was thus intended to be set against the general public hagiography
of Sparta and its intended audience was what I’ve heard termed the ‘Sparta
Bro’ – the person for whom the Spartans represent a positive example (indeed,
often the pinnacle) of masculine achievement, often explicitly connected to
roles in law enforcement, military service and physical fitness (the
regularity with which that last thing is included is striking and suggests to
me the profound unseriousness of the argument). [&hellip;] In that light, I think
the series holds up fairly well.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a former 100% Sparta Bro, I qualified for the target audience. Paraphrasing
Marx, one could say that ignorance is the opium of the people. Take 300 the
movie.  I&rsquo;m glad I saw it as entirely ignorant of Sparta&rsquo;s &lsquo;real&rsquo; prowess, or
most fun would have been spoiled.</p>
