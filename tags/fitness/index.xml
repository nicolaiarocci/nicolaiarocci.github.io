      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like Herman below, I exercise daily. A one-hour brisk walk in the early morning on weekdays before sitting at the desk, and four weekly sessions of bodyweight strength training (known as calisthenics nowadays). If it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a scorching hot day, I&amp;rsquo;ll immediately follow the walk with the training, take a shower, have breakfast, and then start work. In the cooler season, I&amp;rsquo;ll stop working at noon and exercise before lunch instead. During the weekend, I often take long walks, go hiking, or rest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A one-hour brisk walk in the early morning on weekdays before sitting at the desk, and four weekly sessions of bodyweight strength training (known as calisthenics nowadays).

<p>I&rsquo;m turning 55 in a few days, and sometimes I wonder if I should slow down or reduce the intensity of my training. I&rsquo;ve made adjustments along those lines in recent years, but I suspect I am still pretty active for my age.</p>
<p>Today I read <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/exercise/">Herman&rsquo;s post on the ROI of exercise</a>, and it is spot on. It&rsquo;s common sense; we&rsquo;ve all read those things, but here they are nicely compiled. The concept that lifelong exercise &ldquo;adds extra years to each stage of life rather than just frail years at the end&rdquo; hit home for me.</p>
