      <description>Vicki Boykis has a good piece on Redis&amp;rsquo;s recent vicissitudes. At the same time, she recaps where we stand and sings the praises of a project that many are fond of, and not just for its technical worth.
I, like many developers who have worked on high-scale, low-latency web services over the last fifteen years, have an intimate relationship with Redis. At any new job, when you ask where the data is, and someone points you to a server address with port 6379, you know you will meet an good, reliable friend there.</description>

<p>Redis is indeed an awe-inspiring project. I have met Salvatore (antirez), its author, several times. He&rsquo;s a down-to-earth and brilliant guy. I admit I feel nostalgic for Redis&rsquo; &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; period when Salvatore was at the helm and Redis was for developers, not enterprises.</p>

      <description>I read a well-researched story about Redis and its creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, also known as antirez. I was already familiar with many details as I have been following him since OKNotizie and Segnalo, of which I was a user. At the time, as a user, I exchanged a few emails with Salvatore, whom years later I had the pleasure of meeting in person, as we were both speakers at several conferences.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a well-researched story about Redis and its creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, also known as antirez. I was already
familiar with many details as I have been following him since OKNotizie and Segnalo, of which I was a user. At the time,
as a user, I exchanged a few emails with Salvatore, whom years later I had the pleasure of meeting in person, as we were
both speakers at several conferences.</p>
<p>On his website, he apologizes for being unable to respond to all the mail he receives. Well, my experience is the
opposite. I remember one of our several mail exchanges. In 2013 I asked him for git help, and minutes later, he replied
with a custom script he had put together for dealing with that exact problem. Later on, as I was working on a git
presentation for Codemotion (I think), I fired a quick email asking permission to feature his script in my session. The
green light landed seconds later. Salvatore is the epitome of kindness and helpfulness.</p>
<p>As if his pronounced computer skills were not enough, with his latest sci-fi novel Wohpe (on my reading list), he proves
to be endowed with the most diverse capabilities.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://blog.brachiosoft.com/redis-en">here&rsquo;s the antirez &amp; Redis story</a> I mentioned. Worth reading it.</p>
