      <description>I read a well-researched story about Redis and its creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, also known as antirez. I was already familiar with many details as I have been following him since OKNotizie and Segnalo, of which I was a user. At the time, as a user, I exchanged a few emails with Salvatore, whom years later I had the pleasure of meeting in person, as we were both speakers at several conferences.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a well-researched story about Redis and its creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, also known as antirez. I was already
familiar with many details as I have been following him since OKNotizie and Segnalo, of which I was a user. At the time,
as a user, I exchanged a few emails with Salvatore, whom years later I had the pleasure of meeting in person, as we were
both speakers at several conferences.</p>
<p>On his website, he apologizes for being unable to respond to all the mail he receives. Well, my experience is the
opposite. I remember one of our several mail exchanges. In 2013 I asked him for git help, and minutes later, he replied
with a custom script he had put together for dealing with that exact problem. Later on, as I was working on a git
presentation for Codemotion (I think), I fired a quick email asking permission to feature his script in my session. The
green light landed seconds later. Salvatore is the epitome of kindness and helpfulness.</p>
<p>As if his pronounced computer skills were not enough, with his latest sci-fi novel Wohpe (on my reading list), he proves
to be endowed with the most diverse capabilities.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://blog.brachiosoft.com/redis-en">here&rsquo;s the antirez &amp; Redis story</a> I mentioned. Worth reading it.</p>
