      <description>Years ago, I translated an essay by Terry Windling, On Tolkien and Fairie-Stories, from American English to Italian. I remember arguing with the author about her use of periods in quotations. Each quotation would end with a period before the closing mark. I was puzzled. We don&amp;rsquo;t do that in Italy. More importantly, I read many English texts where the period was left outside the quotation itself. She insisted that her style was correct1.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Years ago, I <a href="http://www.endore.it/Arretrati/9/Articoli/SuTolkienELeFiabe.pdf">translated</a> an essay by Terry Windling, <a href="https://accademia.tolkieniana.net/tesi/endicott/tlkefiabeng.html">On Tolkien and
Fairie-Stories</a>, from American English to Italian. I remember arguing with
the author about her use of periods in quotations. Each quotation would end
with a period before the closing mark. I was puzzled. We don&rsquo;t do that in
Italy. More importantly, I read many English texts where the period was left
outside the quotation itself. She insisted that her style was correct<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Today I learn that, in English, there are in fact two different and conflicting
quotation mark punctuation styles: American and British.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are different ways of combining quotation and punctuation marks. In the
American style, you almost always put periods and commas inside the quotation
marks [&hellip;] In the British style, however, you put periods and commas outside
the quotation marks, unless they are part of a complete sentence that is
fully contained between the quotation marks:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/the-american-style-of-quotation-mark-punctuation-makes-no-sense">The American Style of Quotation Mark Punctuation Makes No Sense</a> the
author illustrates the differences between the two styles, then argues that
&ldquo;the British approach makes more sense, so use that one.&rdquo; Whoops.</p>

<p>In my rendition I moved the period after the end mark. Different languages, different rules.
