      <description>A few months ago I started my review of Lansing&amp;rsquo;s Endurance: Shackleton&amp;rsquo;s Incredible Voyage with these words:

Incredible Voyage</em></a> with these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all the stories of maritime adventures I’ve read, that of the Endurance,

</blockquote>
<p>And I meant that. As the book&rsquo;s title suggests, that story is simply
unbelievable, yet true. Imagine my astonishment this morning at the news that
the Endurance was found in the depths of the Antarctic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists have found and filmed one of the greatest ever undiscovered
shipwrecks 107 years after it sank. The Endurance, the lost vessel of
Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, was found at the weekend at the
bottom of the Weddell Sea.</p>
