      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, I will be speaking in Milan at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.webdayconf.it/&#34;&gt;WebDay 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Mine is a hands-on session on building a reliable and
continuous end-to-end testing environment for web apps using Microsoft Playwright. If you attended my &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/my-session-at-wpc-2022/&#34;&gt;introductory
Playwright session at WPC&lt;/a&gt; last year, Thursday&amp;rsquo;s session would be the ideal follow-up to that one, as I
only briefly touched on CI deployments there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from my experience doing the whole thing in production, I&amp;rsquo;ll essentially be live testing a Blazor app, then take
the entire thing to remote CI via GitHub Actions. In the process, I&amp;rsquo;ll show some of the issues we faced, share how we
solved them, and offer some practices we adopted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>WebDay 2023 will be a hybrid event, with over 380 in-person attendees and almost 1300 registered for live streaming.
After the exhilarating experience of being back on an actual stage at WPC a few months ago, I&rsquo;m excited to speak once
again in front of a real crowd.</p>
