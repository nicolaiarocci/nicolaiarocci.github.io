      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://ia.net/topics/the-end-of-writing-ia-on-ai&#34;&gt;iA&amp;rsquo;s grumpy writing about GPT&lt;/a&gt; (with which I sympathize)
when my attention was captured by the image they added to their post. It was so
fascinating that I had to research it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, this is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammarion_engraving&#34;&gt;Flammarion engraving&lt;/a&gt;, a famous wood engraving by
an unknown artist, so named because its first documented appearance is in
Camille Flammarion&amp;rsquo;s 1888 book &lt;em&gt;L&amp;rsquo;atmosphère: météorologie populaire&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;ldquo;The

<p>As it turns out, this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammarion_engraving">Flammarion engraving</a>, a famous wood engraving by
an unknown artist, so named because its first documented appearance is in
Camille Flammarion&rsquo;s 1888 book <em>L&rsquo;atmosphère: météorologie populaire</em> (&ldquo;The
Atmosphere: Popular Meteorology&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The print depicts a man, clothed in a long robe and carrying a staff, at the
edge of the Earth, where it meets the sky. He kneels and passes his head,
shoulders, and right arm through the star-studded sky, discovering a marvelous
realm of circling clouds, fires and suns beyond the heavens. One of the
elements of the cosmic machinery closely resembles traditional pictorial
representations of the &ldquo;wheel in the middle of a wheel&rdquo; described in the
visions of the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel. The caption that accompanies the
engraving in Flammarion&rsquo;s book reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A missionary of the Middle Ages tells that he had found the point where the
sky and the Earth touch&hellip;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Flammarion engraving has inspired and has been used by many writers,
artists, researchers, and jack-of-all-trades. The whole story is available at
the Wikipedia page linked above.</p>
