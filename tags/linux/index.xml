      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/moving-on/&#34;&gt;Moving On&lt;/a&gt;, Simone Silvestroni recounts how he moved away from the Apple ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a move I&amp;rsquo;ve been contemplating for some time. Like Simone, I use Linux at work daily so that the task wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too much of a stretch, but I&amp;rsquo;m probably too lazy (or too old) to execute it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why does &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html&#34;&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; print &amp;ldquo;gimme gimme gimme&amp;rdquo; at 00:30?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maintainer of man is a good friend of mine, and one day six years ago I
jokingly said to him that if you invoke man after midnight it should print
&amp;ldquo;gimme gimme gimme&amp;rdquo;, because of the Abba song called &amp;ldquo;Gimme gimme gimme a man
after midnight&amp;rdquo;.  Well, he did actually put it in. A few people were amused to
discover it, and we mostly forgot about it until today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, something unexpected happened while I was working on one of our Linux
machines. I issued the &lt;code&gt;crontab -e&lt;/code&gt; command to add a cron job to my user&amp;rsquo;s
crontab file, modified and saved it, only to the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;crontab: installing new crontab

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puzzled, I checked whether my user permissions were all right, if the disk was
full, and several other things. Long story short, the fix was this one:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>rsync with a different user</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/rsync-with-a-different-user/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/rsync-with-a-different-user/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned how to rsync with a user different than the one connected to the remote. Why would one want to do such a
thing? The data I need to download from that server is owned by &amp;lsquo;backup,&amp;rsquo; a different, service-only user. I wanted to
avoid going the change-permissions slippery route and allow my user direct access to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the rsync documentation, I learned about the nifty &lt;code&gt;--rsync-path=PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1#opt--rsync-path&#34;&gt;option&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I learned how to rsync with a user different than the one connected to the remote. Why would one want to do such a
thing? The data I need to download from that server is owned by &lsquo;backup,&rsquo; a different, service-only user. I wanted to
avoid going the change-permissions slippery route and allow my user direct access to the data.</p>
<p>Looking at the rsync documentation, I learned about the nifty <code>--rsync-path=PROGRAM</code> <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1#opt--rsync-path">option</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use this to specify what program is to be run on the remote machine to start-up rsync. Often used when rsync is not in
the default remote-shell&rsquo;s path (e.g. &ndash;rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync).</p></blockquote>
<p>The example caught my attention. I could perhaps leverage this option to perform a user switch before executing rsync
(now performed on the remote machine). As further research confirmed, it <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/546296">can be done</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>rsync --rsync-path &#39;sudo -u backup rsync&#39; -a --delete host:source destination
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It didn&rsquo;t work immediately because my user was not a sudoer, but that was an easy fix:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>cat &gt; /etc/sudoers.d/myuser &lt;&lt; EOF
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>myuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/rsync
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>EOF
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you can see, not only must the user be a sudoer, but it also needs to be able to sudo with no password. One last
minor issue was that &lsquo;backup&rsquo;, being a service user, had no shell access. That was another easy fix:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo usermod -s /bin/bash backup
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now my rsync-with-a-different-user command works like a charm. I do have some mild security concerns, though. My user is
a sudoer (can only sudo rsync, though<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), and &lsquo;backup&rsquo; now has shell access. As password logins are turned off, and
SSH keys-only access is allowed to the machine (and I&rsquo;m the only person holding those keys), everything&rsquo;s still
reasonably safe. Are there better ways? Please let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sebastian on Mastodon for <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@DarkMetatron@rollenspiel.social/110939139075153024">pointing out</a> that I should limit the sudoer to just rsync itself. I updated the post accordingly. By the way, this is why I love posting TILs in public.

      <title>Troubles with VirtualBox and the Windows Subsystem for Linux</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/troubles-with-virtualbox-and-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 07:05:25 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/troubles-with-virtualbox-and-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned the hard way: don&amp;rsquo;t you dare running a vanilla install of
VirtualBox together with Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2). It won&amp;rsquo;t work.
That&amp;rsquo;s because WSL2 uses Hyper-V under the hood, which is incompatible with
VirtualBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/admin/hyperv-support.html&#34;&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; for VirtualBox v6.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle VM VirtualBox can be used on a Windows host where Hyper-V is running.
&lt;strong&gt;This is an experimental feature&lt;/strong&gt;. No configuration is required. Oracle VM
VirtualBox detects Hyper-V automatically and uses Hyper-V as the
virtualization engine for the host system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I learned the hard way: don&rsquo;t you dare running a vanilla install of
VirtualBox together with Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2). It won&rsquo;t work.
That&rsquo;s because WSL2 uses Hyper-V under the hood, which is incompatible with
VirtualBox.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/admin/hyperv-support.html">official documentation</a> for VirtualBox v6.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oracle VM VirtualBox can be used on a Windows host where Hyper-V is running.
<strong>This is an experimental feature</strong>. No configuration is required. Oracle VM
VirtualBox detects Hyper-V automatically and uses Hyper-V as the
virtualization engine for the host system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that did not prove to be true in my case. Hence the experimental clause,
I guess. A little googling revealed that, indeed, it did work for a while, then
a new Windows 10 release broke it again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hyper-V API became a viable reality with 1803, practically with 1809. And
it went fine with 1903. And it broke with 1909. Please use your favorite
search engine for &ldquo;Immature API&rdquo;&hellip; (<a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=90853&amp;start=195#p465333">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if it did work, however, you&rsquo;d run into some (possibly) severe
performance degradation. Quoting from the same official documentation page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using this feature, some host systems might experience significant
Oracle VM VirtualBox performance degradation.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t need to run WSL2 and your VMs simultaneously, one workaround is to
disable WSL2 in the Windows Features.  There, you have to disable Hyper-V,
Virtual Machine Platform, and Windows Subsystem for Windows. Yes, I had to
explicitly disable all three of them. When you eventually reactivate them, WSL2
will start working again, configurations included.</p>
<p>Another option is to fallback to WSL1. That will work. Unlike WSL2, WSL1 does
not run in a VM. Also, converting back and forth between WSL1 and WLS2 is dead
simple. I did not go this route because, well, I like the performance that
comes with WSL2. I also plan to use VirtualBox only rarely, when I need to test
new versions of our desktop application&rsquo;s installation procedure.</p>
<p>This is all not ideal, of course. The situation is evolving. <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/issues/536">This ticket</a>
on the WSL documentation repository is probably the place to watch for updates.</p>
<p>Hopefully, soon, once the currently &ldquo;immature API&rdquo; stabilizes, I will be able
to come back to this article, edit it, and note that now everything works as
expected.</p>
