      <description>Today I learned about ShellCheck, a static analysis tool that &amp;ldquo;finds bugs in your scripts&amp;rdquo;. It can and should be run on the command line, but an online version is also available. It catches most style and syntax errors and has plenty of options, like ignoring specific errors and warnings, which is helpful in CI scenarios.</description>

      <description>Today, something unexpected happened while I was working on one of our Linux machines. I issued the crontab -e command to add a cron job to my user&amp;rsquo;s crontab file, modified and saved it, only to the following error:
crontab: installing new crontab crontab: crontabs/&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;: rename: Operation not permitted crontab: edits left in /tmp/crontab.hgmsOH/crontab Puzzled, I checked whether my user permissions were all right, if the disk was full, and several other things.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, something unexpected happened while I was working on one of our Linux

      <title>rsync with a different user</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/rsync-with-a-different-user/</guid>
      <description>Today I learned how to rsync with a user different than the one connected to the remote. Why would one want to do such a thing? The data I need to download from that server is owned by &amp;lsquo;backup,&amp;rsquo; a different, service-only user. I wanted to avoid going the change-permissions slippery route and allow my user direct access to the data.
Looking at the rsync documentation, I learned about the nifty --rsync-path=PROGRAM option:</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I learned how to rsync with a user different than the one connected to the remote. Why would one want to do such a
thing? The data I need to download from that server is owned by &lsquo;backup,&rsquo; a different, service-only user. I wanted to
avoid going the change-permissions slippery route and allow my user direct access to the data.</p>
<p>Looking at the rsync documentation, I learned about the nifty <code>--rsync-path=PROGRAM</code> <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1#opt--rsync-path">option</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use this to specify what program is to be run on the remote machine to start-up rsync. Often used when rsync is not in
the default remote-shell&rsquo;s path (e.g. &ndash;rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The example caught my attention. I could perhaps leverage this option to perform a user switch before executing rsync
(now performed on the remote machine). As further research confirmed, it <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/546296">can be done</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>rsync --rsync-path &#39;sudo -u backup rsync&#39; -a --delete host:source destination
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It didn&rsquo;t work immediately because my user was not a sudoer, but that was an easy fix:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>cat &gt; /etc/sudoers.d/myuser &lt;&lt; EOF
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>myuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/rsync
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>EOF
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you can see, not only must the user be a sudoer, but it also needs to be able to sudo with no password. One last
minor issue was that &lsquo;backup&rsquo;, being a service user, had no shell access. That was another easy fix:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo usermod -s /bin/bash backup
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now my rsync-with-a-different-user command works like a charm. I do have some mild security concerns, though. My user is
a sudoer (can only sudo rsync, though<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), and &lsquo;backup&rsquo; now has shell access. As password logins are turned off, and
SSH keys-only access is allowed to the machine (and I&rsquo;m the only person holding those keys), everything&rsquo;s still
reasonably safe. Are there better ways? Please let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sebastian on Mastodon for <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@DarkMetatron@rollenspiel.social/110939139075153024">pointing out</a> that I should limit the sudoer to just rsync itself. I updated the post accordingly. By the way, this is why I love posting TILs in public.

      <title>Troubles with VirtualBox and the Windows Subsystem for Linux</title>

      <description>Today I learned the hard way: don&amp;rsquo;t you dare running a vanilla install of VirtualBox together with Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2). It won&amp;rsquo;t work. That&amp;rsquo;s because WSL2 uses Hyper-V under the hood, which is incompatible with VirtualBox.
According to the official documentation for VirtualBox v6.0:
Oracle VM VirtualBox can be used on a Windows host where Hyper-V is running. This is an experimental feature. No configuration is required. Oracle VM VirtualBox detects Hyper-V automatically and uses Hyper-V as the virtualization engine for the host system.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I learned the hard way: don&rsquo;t you dare running a vanilla install of
VirtualBox together with Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2). It won&rsquo;t work.
That&rsquo;s because WSL2 uses Hyper-V under the hood, which is incompatible with
VirtualBox.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/admin/hyperv-support.html">official documentation</a> for VirtualBox v6.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oracle VM VirtualBox can be used on a Windows host where Hyper-V is running.
<strong>This is an experimental feature</strong>. No configuration is required. Oracle VM
VirtualBox detects Hyper-V automatically and uses Hyper-V as the
virtualization engine for the host system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that did not prove to be true in my case. Hence the experimental clause,
I guess. A little googling revealed that, indeed, it did work for a while, then
a new Windows 10 release broke it again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hyper-V API became a viable reality with 1803, practically with 1809. And
it went fine with 1903. And it broke with 1909. Please use your favorite
search engine for &ldquo;Immature API&rdquo;&hellip; (<a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=90853&amp;start=195#p465333">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if it did work, however, you&rsquo;d run into some (possibly) severe
performance degradation. Quoting from the same official documentation page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using this feature, some host systems might experience significant
Oracle VM VirtualBox performance degradation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t need to run WSL2 and your VMs simultaneously, one workaround is to
disable WSL2 in the Windows Features.  There, you have to disable Hyper-V,
Virtual Machine Platform, and Windows Subsystem for Windows. Yes, I had to
explicitly disable all three of them. When you eventually reactivate them, WSL2
will start working again, configurations included.</p>
<p>Another option is to fallback to WSL1. That will work. Unlike WSL2, WSL1 does
not run in a VM. Also, converting back and forth between WSL1 and WLS2 is dead
simple. I did not go this route because, well, I like the performance that
comes with WSL2. I also plan to use VirtualBox only rarely, when I need to test
new versions of our desktop application&rsquo;s installation procedure.</p>
<p>This is all not ideal, of course. The situation is evolving. <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/issues/536">This ticket</a>
on the WSL documentation repository is probably the place to watch for updates.</p>
<p>Hopefully, soon, once the currently &ldquo;immature API&rdquo; stabilizes, I will be able
to come back to this article, edit it, and note that now everything works as
expected.</p>
