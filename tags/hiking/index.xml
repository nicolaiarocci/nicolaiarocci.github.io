      <description>Yesterday was a beautiful, sunny, cold winter Sunday. I felt like going out and enjoying nature, so I took a solo hike in the Foreste Casentinesi National Park, about an hour&amp;rsquo;s drive from home.
This one marks my very first technology-assisted hiking adventure. It may seem weird for someone who&amp;rsquo;s been hiking for so long, is a notorious geek and is a professional computer programmer to have never used technology before.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s regular hiking, and then there&amp;rsquo;s Antarctica hiking. Check out brr&amp;rsquo;s report of a Sunday&amp;rsquo;s hike from McMurdo&amp;rsquo;s base up to the tip of Castle Rock, with spectacular views of Mount Erebus and the surroundings.
brr&amp;rsquo;s Antarticta blog is a recent addition to my RSS feed collection. It&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to follow people living and working in the most remote parts of the world.

      <title>Hiking the Alta Via del Granito</title>

      <description>Last year I hiked the Translagorai route while accompanying my nephew and his friend on their first hiking and wild camping experience. To go full circle, I soloed the Alta Via del Granito last weekend, which covers the parts of the Lagorai mountain range not included in the Translagorai. The AVG is supposed to be a three days effort, with overnights to be spent in managed huts (&amp;ldquo;Rifugio&amp;rdquo;), but I wanted to make it in two days while camping in the wilderness.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I went hiking the Translagorai, an 80 km-long trail that traverses the whole Lagorai mountain range in the Alps. The route takes place in a mountain environment where the anthropic pressure is reduced, especially compared to the more famous nearby Dolomites destinations. There are very few managed huts, most of which do not offer overnight stays, and relatively few bivouacs (emergency huts, usually dislocated in the most isolated areas along the hike).</description>

      <description>I recently had the unexpected opportunity of spending a few days in the Alps, climbing and hiking with my daughters. After a few years of hiatus, it felt great to be back romping.
