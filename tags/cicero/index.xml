&lt;p&gt;Not to know what happened before one was born is always to be a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this Cicero quote on &lt;em&gt;Lapham&amp;rsquo;s Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/about&#34;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;. A little &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Cicero&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; dug out the supposedly
original version found in &lt;em&gt;Orator Ad M. Brutum&lt;/em&gt; (46 BC). It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child. For what is the worth of human life,
unless it is woven into the life of our ancestors by the records of history?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
