      <description>Julian Casablancas (The Strokes, The Voidz) says Infinity Repeating is &amp;ldquo;the last Daft Punk song, ever.&amp;rdquo; The song was recorded in 2013 as a demo and left unpublished until it was included in the 10th-anniversary edition of Random Access Memories released a few weeks ago.
The video is a highly addictive masterpiece. Digging into the comments on YouTube, I found that someone attempted a reconstruction of all the citations included. I&amp;rsquo;m especially fond of the 8-16-32-bit graphics animation section.</description>

The video is a highly addictive masterpiece. Digging into the comments on YouTube, I found that someone attempted a
reconstruction of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imBlPXbAv6E&amp;lc=UgzaNoEwyYOxNyc53cB4AaABAg">all the citations included</a>. I&rsquo;m especially fond of the 8-16-32-bit graphics animation section.
Another thing I learned is that Thomas Bangalter, formerly one-half of Daft Punk, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-04-04/daft-punk-member-thomas-bangalter-terrified-ai">said</a> that his fear of artificial
intelligence was a factor in why the group split in 2021.</p>
