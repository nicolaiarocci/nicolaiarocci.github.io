&lt;p&gt;As AI generated content becomes the norm, I believe that human-generated content and raw thoughts and emotion will become more valuable. In many ways, I&amp;rsquo;d rather read a raw, unproduced, and scrappy blog post with grammatical mistakes over perfectly generated content that serves little value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Becoming the machine</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every machine serves a purpose. People need purpose. The temptation to become the machine is higher than ever. The promise of the machine is alluring. If I can just keep chugging forward, I will end up somewhere that is not here. If I can turn myself into a mechanism that takes input and consistently works towards some goal, I will make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] You&amp;rsquo;re not a machine. You&amp;rsquo;re a person. Play to your strengths. Be sharp and strategic like a scalpel, not blunt like a mallet. Stop fetishizing the grind. Dream bigger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
