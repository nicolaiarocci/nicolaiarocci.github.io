      <description>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s OpenAI launch of Sora is, as is always the case with OpenAI, mind-boggling. Marquees Browniee&amp;rsquo;s comment is spot-on, so much so as he&amp;rsquo;s obviously involved in the video-making scene.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think content creators are at risk with Sora, not anytime soon, but, as Marquees repeatedly notes in the video above, just one year ago we thought AI-generated video was a joke.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m always fascinated by these in-depth bibliography efforts, and this one, with its unique 300-page catalog detailing 7,400 titles from Charles Darwin&amp;rsquo;s library, is nothing short of extraordinary.
John van Wyhe, the academic who has led the “overwhelming” endeavour, said it showed the extraordinary extent of Darwin’s research into the work of others.
“It also shows how insanely eclectic Darwin was,” Van Wyhe said. “There is this vast sea of things which might be an American or German news clipping about a duck or invasive grasshoppers.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>“It also shows how insanely eclectic Darwin was,” Van Wyhe said. “There is this vast sea of things which might be an American or German news clipping about a duck or invasive grasshoppers. That’s been the fun part, not the formal books but the other things … all of which pool together to make the theories and publications we all know.”</p>

<p>The Guardian article is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/11/charles-darwin-entire-personal-library-revealed-first-time">here</a>. I had to dig a little to surface the <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/Complete_Library_of_Charles_Darwin.html">actual catalog</a> on the Darwin Online website.

      <title>Spinoza and the art of thinking in dangerous times</title>

      <description>Technically, The New Yorker&amp;rsquo;s Baruch Spinoza and the Art of Thinking in Dangerous Times reviews a book on Spinoza. It is so well conceived that it also offers a practical primer on the philosopher&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on God, nature, democracy, religion and their interaction.
A few steps into his public philosopher career, Spinoza found himself exiled from his Jewish community in Amsterdam. That made him cautious and adept at avoiding an even worse fate, which was entirely possible in the mid-1600s.</description>

Dangerous Times</em> reviews a book on Spinoza. It is so well conceived that it

<p>A few steps into his public philosopher career, Spinoza found himself exiled
from his Jewish community in Amsterdam. That made him cautious and adept at
avoiding an even worse fate, which was entirely possible in the mid-1600s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Spinoza was certainly a champion of political and intellectual
freedom, he had no interest in being a martyr for them, and, if his life teaches
anything about thinking in dangerous times, it is how prudence and boldness can
go hand in hand. Not for nothing did he wear a ring inscribed with the Latin
word “Caute”: “Be cautious.”</p>

      <description>People living in remote Indigenous communities are as happy as those in wealthy developed countries despite having “very little money”, according to new scientific research that could challenge the widely held perception that “money buys happiness”.
Researchers who interviewed 2,966 people in 19 Indigenous and local communities across the world found that on average they were as happy – if not happier – as the average person in high-income western countries.</description>

      <description>Ethan Mollick, one of my few LLM/AI sources, just dropped his first impressions on Gemini Advanced, released today, but which he&amp;rsquo;s been testing for a month in early access.
Let me start with the headline: Gemini Advanced is clearly a GPT-4 class model. The statistics show this, but so does a month of our informal testing. And this is a big deal because OpenAI’s GPT-4 (the paid version of ChatGPT/Microsoft Copilot) has been the dominant AI for well over a year, and no other model has come particularly close.</description>

modern era of blogging surfaced on my RSS feed. In <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/golden-era-blogging/">A Golden Era of

boldly proposes that we live in, you guessed it, a new golden era of blogging.</p>
<p>He argues that the advent of the ads market tainted the original blogging scene
in the mid-2000s, and something similar is now happening in the YouTube scene.
Today&rsquo;s independent blogger is not in it for the money (there&rsquo;s none to be had)
but for passion and an (unconscious?) belief in indie web ideals, and these are
precisely the forces that drove the first wave of bloggers in the 2000s.</p>
<p>We modern bloggers, however, inhabit a tiny self-indulging bubble that is not
comparable with the original scene. But you know what, I feel comfortable in it.</p>

      <description>The History of the Web has an interesting take on the resurgence of blogging and the indie web that seems to be occurring these days.
With roots in the world of fashion, there exists a cyclical principle suggesting that every two decades, previously popular trends “every 20 years or so the trends that were once popular will begin to be on the forefront again.” What’s old is new again. However, these recurring trends aren’t just rip-offs.</description>

What’s old is new again. However, these recurring trends aren’t just rip-offs.
They are remixed and reinterpreted through the lens of a new generation. We are,
perhaps, in a 20 year resurgence for the indie web and blogging.</p>

      <description>A lot of the things David describes in this post resonate with me.
As far as I’ve been able to figure out so far, the things my mind is best at are details and systems. It‘s part of what makes me a good programmer: I can hold a lot of detail in my head about how a system fits together, I can mess around with it more easily than most people, and I can pick up on details other people might miss, such as potential bugs.</description>

<p>I’m not always great at figuring out what someone else is thinking, or
feeling, or even dropping hints about. I can take educated guesses, for sure,
but I don’t necessarily get it right. It also takes a lot of work to keep track
of all the social cues going on whenever there’s a conversation happening, and
all the social conventions most people seem to follow without even thinking. I
can think of several times when someone has asked me how my weekend went, and
it’s completely slipped my mind that the appropriate response is to ask them
about theirs too. It’s not that I don’t care; it’s that I’m having to
concentrate so much on the rest of the social cues that I take longer to catch
up with how the conversation is supposed to go.</p>

      <description>Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons played an outsize role in popularizing fantasy literature, ideas, and themes, as well as inspiring many of its devotees to create their own. Roleplaying, as a formal activity, owes nearly its entire existence to the phenomenal success of D&amp;amp;D. Even more remarkable is the extent to which the computer and video game industry, which is bigger and more profitable than the music and movie industries combined, owes a huge debt to the example set by D&amp;amp;D.</description>

<p>I started playing D&amp;D in high school in the mid-80s. Does that make me a
Stranger Things kid? I&rsquo;m still trying to figure that out, but D&amp;D significantly
impacted me growing up. It probably didn&rsquo;t save my life <a href="https://www.hearsay.tech/2023-10-29-dungeons-and-dragons-saved-my-life.gmi">like it did for
others</a>,
but to an introvert like me, it offered an incredible opportunity to go out,
meet and talk to people, challenging myself and my imagination.</p>
<p>Right before Christmas, I presented myself with an AD&amp;D 5th edition complete
set, partly out of curiosity but also nostalgia. I loved browsing the modern
editions of the Player Handbook, Master Manual, and Monsters Book—so many good
memories. I later bought the Starter Kit, hoping to play at least an evening
session with my &ldquo;kids,&rdquo; as two of them were about to return home from University
(the third is still with us.) We never played that session. In hindsight, it was
a stupid idea.</p>

      <description>Powerful and cautionary story.
I wondered for many years, how all of this could have happened. How people like my grandpa turned into monsters and people around him watched or turned into monsters with him. The last years made this very clear.

      <description>Upon his death in 1543 in Frombork, Poland, Copernicus was buried in the local cathedral. Over the subsequent centuries, the location of his grave was lost to history. There were several unsuccessful attempts to locate Copernicus’s remains, dating as far back as the 16th and 17th centuries. Another failed attempt was made by the French emperor Napoleon after the 1807 Battle of Eylau. Napoleon held Copernicus in high regard as a polymath, mathematician and astronomer.</description>

      <description>The goal of the pg_rman project is to provide a method for online backup and PITR that is as easy as pg_dump. Also, it maintains a backup catalog per database cluster. Users can maintain old backups including archive logs with one command.
We&amp;rsquo;ve always been doing our Postgres backups the rudimentary way via pg_dumpall, which works and is purely logical (one can restore across different Postgres versions), but pg_rman maintains a catalog and has point-in-time recovery.</description>

      <description>Professor Ethan Mollick&amp;rsquo;s Signs and Portents analyzes what AI has achieved, what the effects have been so far, and what we might expect in 2024.
To ground ourselves, we can start with two quotes that should inform any estimates about the future. The first is Amara&amp;rsquo;s Law: &amp;ldquo;We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.&amp;rdquo; Social change is slower than technological change.</description>

<blockquote>

estimates about the future. The first is Amara&rsquo;s Law: &ldquo;We tend to overestimate
the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the

expect to see immediate global effects of AI in a major way, no matter how fast
its adoption (and it is remarkably fast), yet we certainly will see it sooner
than many people think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an insightful read that pairs well with Simon Wilson&rsquo;s <a href="/stuff-we-figured-out-about-ai-in-2023/">2023

      <description>Simon Wilson, who&amp;rsquo;s recently been my go-to person for all AI-related stuff, has an excellent 2023 AI round-up on his website.
2023 was the breakthrough year for Large Language Models (LLMs). I think it&amp;rsquo;s OK to call these AI—they&amp;rsquo;re the latest and (currently) most &amp;ldquo;interesting development in the academic field of Artificial Intelligence that dates back to the 1950s. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt to round up the highlights in one place!</description>

      <title>How Many Hobbits?</title>

      <description>For those who don’t know me, I’m a demographer. I study population. And my first love in fantasy was, of course, Middle Earth. How many people live in Middle Earth? Being a demographer, I was mainly interested in the data side of things.
Tolkien is frustratingly vague about population. He almost never gives us estimates of settlement sizes, and many of the larger metropolises of Middle Earth (like Pelargir) never actually appear on the page.</description>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

He almost never gives us estimates of settlement sizes, and many of the larger metropolises of Middle Earth (like Pelargir) never actually appear on the page. Sizable armies make frequent appearances, yet because his adventurers almost exclusively traverse the wilds of Middle Earth, we rarely see where those soldiers are coming from.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost every attempt to estimate population in Middle Earth extrapolates from army sizes.  This is no surprise since those are some of the only numbers Tolkien does provide and, furthermore, historically, this is also how ancient populations in the real world are often estimated, so there are some credible rules-of-thumb out there.</p>

<p>I wanted to take a new approach.</p>

      <description>Andrej Karpathy has a very well-done Intro to Large Language Models video on YouTube. As a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI and with a two-year hiatus working on Tesla Autopilot, Karpathy is an authority in the field. He is also good at explaining hard things.
As a Kahneman reader, I appreciated the Thinking Fast and Slow analogy proposed at about half-length in the video: &amp;ldquo;System 1&amp;rdquo; (fast automatic thinking, rapid decisions) is where we&amp;rsquo;re now; &amp;ldquo;System 2&amp;rdquo; (rational, slow thinking, complex decisions) is LLMs next goal.</description>

&ldquo;System 1&rdquo; (fast automatic thinking, rapid decisions) is where we&rsquo;re now; &ldquo;System 2&rdquo; (rational, slow thinking, complex

system style&rdquo; is not too far off from what will emerge soon. The final segment on AI security and known attack vectors
(jailbreaking, prompt injection, data poisoning) is also super interesting.</p>
<p>On his website, Karpathy also has a promising <a href="https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html">zero-to-hero video series</a>, &ldquo;a

      <description>Imagine, for a moment, that you are walking along a dirt road in the seventh century Middle East. The sun is hot, the air is dry, your feet are tired. It’s been a long journey, by boat and foot, from your home in Constantinople to where you find yourself now: outside of the walls of the mountainous river city of Antioch. In the bright sunlight, you strain your eyes to catch a distant glimpse of the sight you’ve come all this way to see – and then suddenly, you do.</description>

you find yourself now: outside of the walls of the mountainous river city of Antioch. In the bright sunlight, you

A bright stone pillar, stretching as tall as a church dome with an unsteady-looking wooden platform; and atop it a
tiny, bedraggled, flinty old man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You’ve found him: the Pillar Saint.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To our modern eyes, this is a profoundly weird image – but it would have been a recognisable, even iconic, one if we
were living in the early medieval Middle East. To explain how we got here – and how that guy got on that pillar - we
need to step back and tell the origin story of one of the most recognisable characters in medieval life: the monk.</p>

      <description>Donald Knuth challenged ChatGPT-4 with 20 questions and then submitted the results and his comments to Stephen Wolfram. The whole thing is fascinating in many ways and worth reading.
Some remarkable quotes:
Of course these are extremely impressive responses, sometimes astonishingly so; thus I totally understand why you and others have been paying attention to it.
The most immediate impression is the quality of the wordsmithing. It&amp;rsquo;s way better than 99% of copy that people actually write.</description>

<a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/chatGPT20.txt">whole thing</a> is fascinating in many ways and worth reading.</p>
<p>Some remarkable quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course these are extremely impressive responses, sometimes astonishingly so; thus I totally understand why you and
others have been paying attention to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The most immediate impression is the quality of the wordsmithing. It&rsquo;s way better than 99% of copy that people
actually write. It&rsquo;s definitely not like a Markov model that uses the most predictable way to continue what&rsquo;s already
been said. On the other hand there are surprising lapses there too, as typical of any large system.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer #10 reads as though it&rsquo;s the best answer yet. But it&rsquo;s almost totally wrong!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how the confident tone lends credibility to all of that made-up nonsense. Almost impossible for anybody
without knowledge of the book to believe that those &ldquo;facts&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t authorititative and well researched.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I find it fascinating that novelists galore have written for decades about scenarios that might occur after a
&ldquo;singularity&rdquo; in which superintelligent machines exist. But as far as I know, not a single novelist has realized that
such a singularity would almost surely be preceded by a world in which machines are 0.01% intelligent (say), and in
which millions of real people would be able to interact with them freely at essentially no cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I myself shall certainly continue to leave such research to others, and to devote my time to developing concepts that
are authentic and trustworthy. And I hope you do the same.</p>

      <title>Story of Redis and its creator antirez</title>

      <description>I read a well-researched story about Redis and its creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, also known as antirez. I was already familiar with many details as I have been following him since OKNotizie and Segnalo, of which I was a user. At the time, as a user, I exchanged a few emails with Salvatore, whom years later I had the pleasure of meeting in person, as we were both speakers at several conferences.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a well-researched story about Redis and its creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, also known as antirez. I was already
familiar with many details as I have been following him since OKNotizie and Segnalo, of which I was a user. At the time,
as a user, I exchanged a few emails with Salvatore, whom years later I had the pleasure of meeting in person, as we were
both speakers at several conferences.</p>
<p>On his website, he apologizes for being unable to respond to all the mail he receives. Well, my experience is the
opposite. I remember one of our several mail exchanges. In 2013 I asked him for git help, and minutes later, he replied
with a custom script he had put together for dealing with that exact problem. Later on, as I was working on a git
presentation for Codemotion (I think), I fired a quick email asking permission to feature his script in my session. The
green light landed seconds later. Salvatore is the epitome of kindness and helpfulness.</p>
<p>As if his pronounced computer skills were not enough, with his latest sci-fi novel Wohpe (on my reading list), he proves
to be endowed with the most diverse capabilities.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://blog.brachiosoft.com/redis-en">here&rsquo;s the antirez &amp; Redis story</a> I mentioned. Worth reading it.</p>

      <description>Minimalist News is the first LLM project that excites me but in a nervous way. Quoting the About page:
We only publish significant news. To find them we use AI (ChatGPT-4) to read and analyze 1000 top news every day. For each article it estimates magnitude, scale, potential and credibility. Then we combine these estimates to get the final Significance score from 0 to 10. And now the best part: We&amp;rsquo;ll only send you the news scored 6.</description>

<p>The concept is brilliant and well executed, but I can&rsquo;t help but feel uncomfortable at the notion of an AI curating news

      <description>A fascinating article surfaced on Nautilus last week. Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of religion and science in society at Wesleyan University, shares her concerns about the technical strides and aspirations of Elon Musk&amp;rsquo;s SpaceX, the company&amp;rsquo;s mission to enable thousands of people to live on Mars, and the ethics of terraforming the planet to be more like Earth. What&amp;rsquo;s intriguing, though, is Rubenstein&amp;rsquo;s thoughts about the religious underpinnings of the United States space program and how even modern science is still hostage to imperialistic Christian ideas.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fascinating article surfaced on Nautilus last week. Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of religion and science in
society at Wesleyan University, shares her concerns about the technical strides and aspirations of Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX,
the company&rsquo;s mission to enable thousands of people to live on Mars, and the ethics of terraforming the planet to be
more like Earth. What&rsquo;s intriguing, though, is Rubenstein&rsquo;s thoughts about the religious underpinnings of the United
States space program and how even modern science is still hostage to imperialistic Christian ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I started realizing that religion shows up in the natural sciences and the contemporary world in a funny and alarming
way,” Rubenstein said. “Because sciences tend to think of themselves as something as far away as possible from
religion, as having freed themselves from God. To an extent that’s true. But in the process, they tend to generate
these big stories, big mythologies, about the origins and the ends of the world. And conjure characters who are
heroes, gods, and monsters. I started tracking the way that the natural sciences themselves generate new ways of
understanding the world that, a couple centuries ago, we would have called religion.”</p>

      <description>Pitchfork has a great piece on Sun Ra and his legacy. It&amp;rsquo;s worth reading if you&amp;rsquo;re a fan, even more so if you know nothing about him.
But what Sun Ra had done, and done best, was reminding earthlings everywhere that he wasn’t mortal. He was a signifier of a life beyond the reality of this one. He was a visual reassurance of the presence of another world. He brought the cosmos to the streets, and, most importantly, he was a reminder that one does not have to subscribe to the status quo—musically, stylistically, politically, ideologically.</description>

      <description>In the mid-to-late 80s, my excitement used to culminate by the end of the month when BYTE&amp;rsquo;s new issue would hit the newsstands1. In my small Italian hometown, only one, sometimes two, newsstands would sometime get a copy (BYTE was published in the US and copies sent abroad were scarce; only major, close-to-the-train-station stands had a chance to receive it). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only kid in town interested in that elusive one issue; I had an anonymous competitor.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the mid-to-late 80s, my excitement used to culminate by the end of the month when BYTE&rsquo;s new issue would hit the
newsstands<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In my small Italian hometown, only one, sometimes two, newsstands would sometime get a copy (BYTE was
published in the US and copies sent abroad were scarce; only major, close-to-the-train-station stands had a chance to
receive it). I wasn&rsquo;t the only kid in town interested in that elusive one issue; I had an anonymous competitor. The race
was on every third week of the month, give or take. You see, the thing is, back then, computer magazines were the only
source of reliable, precious information on everything hardware and software. I could barely read English at that age.
Yet, I spent whole afternoons stubbornly reading the magazine cover to cover, probably understanding only fifty percent
of its content. Rather than at school, I learned most of my English by reading computer magazines.</p>
<p>This morning, these memories were brought back to me while reading <a href="https://www.technologizer.com/2023/04/15/the-end-of-computer-magazines-in-america">The End of Computer Magazines in America</a> by Harry
McCracken. He was involved with the computer magazine industry in its golden age, so the article has exciting insights.
I also appreciated the several former colleagues and competitors who commented, helping frame the period. Computer
magazines are dead indeed, and it&rsquo;s a bittersweet sensation. Quoting McCracken&rsquo;s closing words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do remain grateful that computer magazines existed. Their time has passed—but what a time it was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However useful these programs may be in some narrow domains (they can be helpful in computer programming, for
example, or in suggesting rhymes for light verse), we know from the science of linguistics and the philosophy of
knowledge that they differ profoundly from how humans reason and use language. These differences place significant
limitations on what these programs can do, encoding them with ineradicable defects.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just back from reading Programmer Interrupted: The Real Cost of Interruption and Context Switching, an interesting short piece in which I learned about at least two new things.
First, The Parable of the Two Watchmakers, introduced by Nobel Prize winner Herbert Simon, describes the complex relationship between sub-systems and their larger wholes. In the context of the article, it helps explain, even for non-programmers, the cost of an interruption. It also hints at a possible mitigation technique:</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m just back from reading <a href="https://contextkeeper.io/blog/the-real-cost-of-an-interruption-and-context-switching/">Programmer Interrupted: The Real Cost of Interruption and Context Switching</a>, an interesting
short piece in which I learned about at least two new things.</p>
<p>First, <em>The Parable of the Two Watchmakers</em>, introduced by Nobel Prize winner Herbert Simon, describes the complex
relationship between sub-systems and their larger wholes. In the context of the article, it helps explain, even for
non-programmers, the cost of an interruption. It also hints at a possible mitigation technique:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang
frequently and new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and
poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to
put down a partly assembled watch, it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.
Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together sub-assemblies of about ten components each, and each
sub-assembly could be put down without falling apart. Ten of these sub-assemblies could be put together to make a
larger sub-assembly, and ten of the larger sub-assemblies constituted the whole watch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, larger computer screens help a programmer keep his mental model (and context) together. I&rsquo;m still deciding on
this one. Focusing on a single window or not having a lot of cruft around the screen helps solve complex code for me.
But toss anything John Carmack at me, and I will abide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 640 x 480 resolution was the standard from 1990 to around 1996, but it was possible to get more screen real estate
back then. There is a famous photo of John Carmack working on Quake using a 28-inch 1080p monitor in 1995.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did he choose 45 kg monitor for about $10k in 1995? The higher screen real estate allowed for more code to be
visible at once, resulting in a more dense context. Productivity greatly increases when you have the ability to store
and access more detailed context. It&rsquo;s like having a larger desk to hold documents when studying for an exam or doing
any task that requires the use of multiple sources of information from a common domain, such as solving puzzles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The brilliant comic that opens the article is the perfect TL;DR for the Watchmakers parable.</p>

Last month one of our journalists received an interesting email. A researcher had come across mention of a Guardian article, written by the journalist on a specific subject from a few years before.

detailed records we keep of all our content, and especially around deletions or legal issues, they could find no trace

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian Rinaldi has an insightful post on <a href="https://remotesynthesis.com/blog/developer-conferences/">his blog</a> about the current state of
developer conferences, where &lsquo;current state&rsquo; means post-COVID pandemic. Brian
is well-positioned to reason about this space as a long-time conference
organizer. I appreciate that he also takes the time to explain how the
developer conference business works. The core of his blog is about
post-pandemic conference attendance, which has plunged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>independent, in-person developer conferences are hurting. Based on my own
observation as well as talks with organizers and sponsors that I have come to
know over the years, the average independent in-person event is still down
30-40% from pre-pandemic attendance levels. And often it seems to require
massive discounts or even giveaways to get to this level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he offers an interesting theory on why that is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My hypothesis is that we’ve bifurcated the audience somewhat. The folks that
were there almost exclusively for the content have decided that they can do
so more cheaply and efficiently online via virtual conferences or recordings.
The folks that went for the networking as a primary driver, on the other
hand, are largely eschewing online events as not fulfilling their needs.
[&hellip;] So ultimately what we are left with is a lower in-person audience and a
lower virtual audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a conference speaker and meetup organizer, I noticed that online events saw
low attendance during the pandemic, and they still do today. When available,
recordings partially compensate, but only in audience terms. The problem is
online events are not conferences. &lsquo;Conference&rsquo; originates from the late Latin
&ldquo;conferentia,&rdquo; itself a derivative of &ldquo;conferre,&rdquo; a synonym for the collation
of &ldquo;bring together&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A conference is a meeting to discuss some topics. The
get-together element is missing in online events, and networking is next to
impossible (live chats and &lsquo;virtual after-parties&rsquo; are just poor palliatives.)
In my book, hybrid events are even worse, as live streaming and recordings
discourage live attendance (at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/DevRomagna">DevRomagna meetups</a>, we often get asked
if live streaming or recordings will be available, and the answer is no -
either we do live streaming - and we sometimes do - or we do an in-person
event, but never a mix of the two.)</p>
<p>Going back to Brian&rsquo;s musings, I think I subscribe to them. I am not sure
attendance will ever get back to old numbers. I am afraid a good portion of
those who were regulars became disaffected, and gaining their attention back is
a hard gamble. YouTube and Twitch, I think, are phenomenal competitors, and the
pandemic hiatus threw a ton of fresh new viewers at them.</p>
<p>PS: Coincidentally, we&rsquo;re running an in-person meetup at DevRomagna <a href="https://nicolaiarocci.com/heading-to-go-a-look-at-building-a-video-encoder-meetup/">today</a>.</p>

      <description>I was reading iA&amp;rsquo;s grumpy writing about GPT (with which I sympathize) when my attention was captured by the image they added to their post. It was so fascinating that I had to research it.
As it turns out, this is the Flammarion engraving, a famous wood engraving by an unknown artist, so named because its first documented appearance is in Camille Flammarion&amp;rsquo;s 1888 book L&amp;rsquo;atmosphère: météorologie populaire (&amp;ldquo;The Atmosphere: Popular Meteorology&amp;rdquo;).</description>

</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammarion_engraving">Flammarion engraving</a>, a famous wood engraving by
an unknown artist, so named because its first documented appearance is in
Camille Flammarion&rsquo;s 1888 book <em>L&rsquo;atmosphère: météorologie populaire</em> (&ldquo;The
Atmosphere: Popular Meteorology&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The print depicts a man, clothed in a long robe and carrying a staff, at the
edge of the Earth, where it meets the sky. He kneels and passes his head,
shoulders, and right arm through the star-studded sky, discovering a marvelous
realm of circling clouds, fires and suns beyond the heavens. One of the
elements of the cosmic machinery closely resembles traditional pictorial
representations of the &ldquo;wheel in the middle of a wheel&rdquo; described in the
visions of the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel. The caption that accompanies the
engraving in Flammarion&rsquo;s book reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A missionary of the Middle Ages tells that he had found the point where the
sky and the Earth touch&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Flammarion engraving has inspired and has been used by many writers,
artists, researchers, and jack-of-all-trades. The whole story is available at
the Wikipedia page linked above.</p>

      <title>Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s surprising turnaround</title>

      <description>According to the always-interesting Ted Gioia, the recent turnaround of Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is to be attributed to the company&amp;rsquo;s new CEO and his love of books. Quite astonishingly James Daunt, who took the helm of B&amp;amp;N in late 2019, refused to take promotional money from publishers:
Daunt refused to play this game. He wanted to put the best books in the window. He wanted to display the most exciting books by the front door.</description>

Quite astonishingly James Daunt, who took the helm of B&amp;N in late 2019, refused
to take promotional money from publishers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daunt refused to play this game. He wanted to put the best books in the

more impressive, he let the people working in the stores make these
decisions. This is James Daunt&rsquo;s superpower: He loves books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/what-can-we-learn-from-barnes-and">whole piece</a> is worth reading. Of all the libraries in my hometown,
there&rsquo;s only one (not a franchise) doing the same, and I genuinely enjoy
walking up to their window to spot new titles. I appreciate that the owners
take their time to pick worthy books and that I get to contemplate their
opinionated selection. They also organize group readings and other activities
seldom found in franchise libraries. Their only downside, valid for all small
libraries, is that almost every time I need a particular title, it&rsquo;ll have to
be back-ordered, which sadly makes Amazon unbeatable.</p>

      <description>Slow Sunday morning, while surfing the YouTube ocean, I stumbled upon the audio recording of David Foster Wallace&amp;rsquo;s This is Water speech. Any DFW fan knows about the commencement speech he famously gave at Kenyon College in 2005, and I&amp;rsquo;m probably one of the few who hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet listened to it. So this morning, I hit the play button and was blown away by it. Unsurprisingly, I guess, as the speech was met with universal acclaim.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Slow Sunday morning, while surfing the YouTube ocean, I stumbled upon the audio
recording of David Foster Wallace&rsquo;s This is Water speech. Any DFW fan knows
about the commencement speech he famously gave at Kenyon College in 2005, and
I&rsquo;m probably one of the few who hadn&rsquo;t yet listened to it. So this morning, I
hit the play button and was blown away by it. Unsurprisingly, I guess, as the
speech was met with universal acclaim.</p>
<p>I suspect my being an adult father of three kids played a role, as I was
nodding all the time, often feeling emotional about it. Anyway, <a href="https://youtu.be/DCbGM4mqEVw">here&rsquo;s the
YouTube recording</a> I&rsquo;m talking about, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080213082423/http://www.marginalia.org/dfw_kenyon_commencement.html">here&rsquo;s a transcription</a> I dug
out of the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>Spoiler warning, I&rsquo;m now going to quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Water">Wikipedia</a>, where I found a good
summarization of the themes covered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The speech covers subjects including the difficulty of empathy, the
unimportance of being well-adjusted, and the apparent lonesomeness of adult
life. It suggests that higher education&rsquo;s overall purpose is to consciously
choose how to perceive others, think about meaning, and act appropriately in
everyday life. Wallace argues that the true freedom acquired through
education is the ability to be fully conscious and sympathetic. Authors
Robert K. Bolger and Scott Korb have said that Wallace used the speech to
outline his spiritual philosophy and the methods he used to find peace when
wrestling with anxiety and depression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also learned on Wikipedia that the speech&rsquo;s themes were expanded in Wallace&rsquo;s
novel <em>The Pale King</em>, posthumously published in 2011. With all its
intimidating size, the Pale King has been sitting on my nightstand (aka reading
list) for ages. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to deal with it.</p>

      <description>On New Years Day of 2022, I stumbled out of bed and immediately lost my vision, fell to the floor, and had to get my then-partner to help me back into bed. This wasn’t the first time this had happened, and I knew what it was straight away - I was having a migraine. In the previous decade I’d had countless migraines, and they always followed the same pattern. I’d wake up after a night out, attempt to get to the bathroom, lose my vision, and most likely end up on the floor vomiting from the pain that I can only describe as feeling like someone trying to hammer a nail into my skull.</description>

The latter isn’t a failure so much as a necessary period of rest. Dormancy isn’t stagnant; it’s potentiating. It’s patient.

In fact, I find that I change my own mind on things a lot when I try write them down. It really is a powerful tool for finding clarity in your own mind. Once you have clarity in your own mind, you&amp;rsquo;re much more able to explain it to others.</description>

In direct lineage, it was the father of the globally successful Command &amp;amp; Conquer franchise, in that its code was used as a basis of the first game of the series. Yet in terms of wider influence, the battles first fought out on the vibrant sands of Arrakis continue to echo through modern videogaming.</description>

<p>I have been on Mastodon for a few weeks now, and wow, what a breath of fresh
air. I&rsquo;m only syndicating to Twitter (and have been for a while, as you might
have noticed) while I&rsquo;m active and engaged on Masto. I know this is breaking my
<a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> stance so much that I&rsquo;ve set up my own Masto instance so I could own my
content over there like I do with this website. I never switched from fosstodon
(which is an instance I like a lot), though. I&rsquo;ll wait a little bit and then
decide on the move.</p>
<p>What impresses me is the atmosphere and overall level of engagement on Masto. I
have 2.1k followers on Twitter and just a little over 100 on Masto, and yet,
the Masto feed is so much richer and more interesting, and the interaction
level is incomparable. The Masto vibe these days reminds me of Twitter when I
joined back in 2009. Better yet, of the old BBS days, or Usenet. Hopefully, it
will last, and, for the reasons outlined by Marcus&rsquo; post above (mandatory read,
IMHO), I am confident it will.</p>

&amp;ldquo;On Sunday, June 21, 1970, in an office building on Great Portland Street in London, a teletype sprang to life.

about <a href="https://inference-review.com/article/the-origins-of-python">The Origins of Python</a>, an essay by his mentor, Lambert Meertens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On Sunday, June 21, 1970, in an office building on Great Portland Street in
London, a teletype sprang to life. Under the heading &ldquo;HAPPY FAMILIES,&rdquo; the
machine rattled out a sequence of English sentences, such as &ldquo;THE DOG SITS ON
THE BABY&rdquo; and &ldquo;UNCLE TED PLAYS WITH SISTER.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Happy Families&rdquo; program
that produced this output had been written that same weekend by someone with
no prior programming experience, a participant in a workshop organized by the
Computer Arts Society offering a course in &ldquo;non-numerical programming.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost fifty years later, on October 26, 2019, in Istanbul, the eyes of a
young woman lit up as she managed to get her very first program to run. She
was attending a workshop organized by Django Girls, an international
non-profit organization aiming to empower women through free, one-day
programming workshops.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The programming language used at the London workshop in 1970 was TELCOMP, a
simple unstructured language similar to BASIC—not BASIC as it is now, but
unstructured BASIC as it was then. The programming language taught at the
Istanbul workshop in 2019 was Python, a programming language designed by Guido
van Rossum that has become wildly popular, steadily gaining in popularity
since an inconspicuous public release in 1991. As far apart as these events
are, both in time and geography, an arc of history connects them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is a magnificent article. If you&rsquo;re passionate about Python, and programming
languages in general, make sure to read it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

      <description>As someone who&amp;rsquo;s been on board with Twitter since 2009, I have to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m very concerned with recent developments. I admire and respect Elon Musk for his companies&amp;rsquo; achievements, especially in space and electric movement industries, but the man himself, holy cow, what a drag.
On The Verge, Nilay Patel&amp;rsquo;s brutal piece on the recent Twitter acquisition is chock-full of brilliant insights on what it takes to run a modern commercial social service.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As someone who&rsquo;s been on board with Twitter since 2009, I have to admit that
I&rsquo;m <em>very</em> concerned with recent developments. I admire and respect Elon Musk
for his companies&rsquo; achievements, especially in space and electric movement
industries, but the man himself, holy cow, what a drag.</p>
<p>On The Verge, Nilay Patel&rsquo;s brutal piece on the recent Twitter acquisition is
chock-full of brilliant insights on what it takes to run a modern commercial
social service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You fucked up real good, kiddo. Twitter is a disaster clown car company that
is successful despite itself, and there is no possible way to grow users and
revenue without making a series of enormous compromises that will ultimately
destroy your reputation and possibly cause grievous damage to your other
companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I say this with utter confidence because the problems with Twitter are not
engineering problems. They are political problems. Twitter, the company,
makes very little interesting technology; the tech stack is not the valuable
asset. The asset is the user base: hopelessly addicted politicians,
reporters, celebrities, and other people who should know better but keep
posting anyway. You! You, Elon Musk, are addicted to Twitter. You’re the
asset. You just bought yourself for $44 billion dollars.</p>

      <description>In 1701, in Middletown, New Jersey, Moses Butterworth languished in a jail, accused of piracy. Like many young men based in England or her colonies, he had joined a crew that sailed the Indian Ocean intent on plundering ships of the Muslim Mughal Empire. Throughout the 1690s, these pirates marauded vessels laden with gold, jewels, silk, and calico on pilgrimage toward Mecca. After achieving great success, many of these men sailed back into the Atlantic via Madagascar to the North American seaboard, where they quietly disembarked in Charleston, Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York City, Newport, and Boston, and made themselves at home.</description>

      <description>Studies have found that high levels of social media use are connected with an increased risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression. There appears to be substantial evidence connecting people’s mental health and their online habits. Furthermore, many psychologists believe people may be dealing with psychological effects that are pervasive but not always obvious.

      <description>Ben Werdmuller has a terrific post up on his website. His &amp;ldquo;tortured&amp;rdquo; analogy of the web and governments as platforms for people to build upon is fascinating.
I believe strongly in the indieweb principles of distributed ownership, control, and independence. For me, the important thing is that this is how we get to a diverse web. A web where everyone can define not just what they write but how they present is by definition far more expressive, diverse, and interesting than one where most online content and identities must be squished into templates created by a handful of companies based on their financial needs.</description>

      <description>Jacob Kaplan-Moss&amp;rsquo;s hot take on software quality:
Software quality is more the result of a system designed to produce quality, and not so much the result of individual performance. That is: a group of mediocre programmers working with a structure designed to produce quality will produce better software than a group of fantastic programmers working in a system designed with other goals.
This leads to the insightful conclusion:
Instead of spending tons of time and effort on hiring because you believe that you can “only hire the best”, direct some of that effort towards building a system that produces great results out of a wider spectrum of individual performance.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/fairy-tales/">Robin Rendle</a> quoting Neil Gaiman, who is quoting G.K. Chesterton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fairy tales, as G.K. Chesterton once said, are more than true. Not because
they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be
defeated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Literary">somewhere</a> that he based the Gilbert character from <em>The Sandman</em>
on Chesterton, so it&rsquo;s no surprise to find Gaiman quoting Chesterton in <em>Smoke
and Mirrors</em>.</p>
<p>Wanting to find the work in which the quote first appeared, I did
a little research only to discover that G.K. Chesterton never actually wrote
it. According to <a href="https://alleysiande.com/random-thoughts/gk-chesterton-an-actual-quote">E.M. Goldsmith</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, Gaiman&rsquo;s is a rework of the following
original quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fairy Tales then, are not responsible for producing in children fear, or any
of the shapes of fear; fairy tales do not give the child the idea of the evil
or the ugly; that is in the child already, because it is in the world
already. <strong>Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What
fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of
bogey</strong>. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an
imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the
dragon. Exactly what the fairy tale does is this: it accustoms him to
a series of clear pictures of <strong>the idea that these limitless terrors had
a limit, that these shapeless enemies have enemies in the knights of God,
that there is something in the universe more mystical than darkness, and
stronger than strong fear.</strong> &ndash;Tremendous Trifles (1909), XVII: &ldquo;The Red
Angel&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An excellently simplified, actualized and de-Christianized rework, I&rsquo;d say.  On
the subject of fairy tales, E.M. Goldsmith has another quote that is worth
sharing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we step into the family, by the act of being born, we do step into
a world which is incalculable, into a world which has its own strange laws,
into a world which could do without us, into a world we have not made. In
other words, when we step into the family we step into a fairy-tale.&quot;
–Heretics, CW, I, p.143 G.K. Chesterton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What great of a writer Chesterton was. No wonder Jorge Luis Borges and J.R.R.
Tolkien were some of his great estimators. On Chesterton, Borges supposedly<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
said: &ldquo;Literature is one of the forms of happiness; perhaps no writer has given
me as many happy hours as Chesterton.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Along with many others on the Internet, E.M. Goldsmith attributes the simplified quote to the popular TV show <em>Criminal Minds</em>. It&rsquo;d be interesting to find who quoted who here.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

retrospective, Bret writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The series was thus intended to be set against the general public hagiography
of Sparta and its intended audience was what I’ve heard termed the ‘Sparta

often the pinnacle) of masculine achievement, often explicitly connected to
roles in law enforcement, military service and physical fitness (the
regularity with which that last thing is included is striking and suggests to
me the profound unseriousness of the argument). [&hellip;] In that light, I think
the series holds up fairly well.</p>

<p>As a former 100% Sparta Bro, I qualified for the target audience. Paraphrasing
Marx, one could say that ignorance is the opium of the people. Take 300 the
movie.  I&rsquo;m glad I saw it as entirely ignorant of Sparta&rsquo;s &lsquo;real&rsquo; prowess, or
most fun would have been spoiled.</p>

      <title>Becoming the Emperor</title>

      <description>Today, probably not just by coincidence, I came across Becoming the Emperor, an excellent New Yorker piece from 2005 on Memoirs of Hadrian, Yourcenar&amp;rsquo;s other works, and her peculiar career and life trajectory. Having just read the Memoirs, I was glad to see several of my reading impressions confirmed. I found the New Yorker article to be spot-on on Yourcenar&amp;rsquo;s prose and theme:
Actually, some of Yourcenar’s prose is marmoreal, but not so that you can’t get through it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, probably not just by coincidence, I came across <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/becoming-the-emperor">Becoming the Emperor</a>, an
excellent New Yorker piece from 2005 on Memoirs of Hadrian, Yourcenar&rsquo;s other
works, and her peculiar career and life trajectory. Having just read the
Memoirs, I was glad to see several of <a href="https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-memoirs-of-hadrian/">my reading impressions</a> confirmed.
I found the New Yorker article to be spot-on on Yourcenar&rsquo;s prose and theme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually, some of Yourcenar’s prose is marmoreal, but not so that you can’t
get through it. Also, it is beautiful. What made her remarkable, however, was
not so much her style as the quality of her mind. Loftiness served her well
as an artist: she was able to dispense love and justice, heat and cold in
equal parts. Above all, her high sense of herself gave her the strength to
take on a great topic: time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was caught off-guard by the idea, conceived by many critics, that her writing
style resembles a man rather than a woman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, many of her narratives were set in the past. Second, they often
involved towering passions compacted into tight, steel-band forms. [&hellip;] She
continued to embrace anti-sentimentality; indeed, she showed a fondness for
brutality. And those traits, together with her highly controlled prose,
encouraged reviewers to say—as they would say throughout her life—that she
wrote like a man. As one critic put it, he could not find in her work “those
often charming weaknesses&hellip; by which one identifies a feminine pen. The
hand does not yield, it does not caress the paper; it is clasped by an iron
gauntlet.” This opinion was fortified by the fact that most of her
protagonists were men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intriguing and, now that I have been enlightened, shareable.</p>

      <title>Stripe releases MarkDoc and that&#39;s a good thing</title>

      <description>Stripe docs are a marvel, and every developer who&amp;rsquo;s had to deal with them knows it. After years of painful PayPal interactions, I remember the amazement and the feverish grin on my face the first time I landed on their API reference. Stripe API is beautifully designed, but it&amp;rsquo;s the combination of good design and excellent documentation that paved Stripe&amp;rsquo;s fulgid success.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://stripe.com/docs">Stripe docs</a> are a marvel, and every developer who&rsquo;s had to deal with them knows
it. After years of painful PayPal interactions, I remember the amazement and
the feverish grin on my face the first time I landed on their API reference.
Stripe API is beautifully designed, but it&rsquo;s the combination of good design and
excellent documentation that paved Stripe&rsquo;s fulgid success.</p>
<p>A few days ago, they unexpectedly released <a href="https://markdoc.io/">MarkDoc</a>, the &ldquo;powerful,
flexible, Markdown-based authoring framework&rdquo; they use internally to build
their documentation. I skimmed through it only rapidly and, unsurprisingly, got
a great first impression.</p>
<p>Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti, who <a href="https://passo.uno/about">knows better than me about docs</a>, published
a solid first-glance <a href="https://passo.uno/markdoc-review/">review of MarkDoc</a> that I think is worth reading.
Spoiler alert, I&rsquo;m quoting below his excellent closing thoughts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The secret to Stripe docs does not lie in superior tooling or magical markup
variants: rather, the reason for their success must be found in the quality
of their docs team, whose information architecture needs caused Markdoc to
happen. This is the kind of magic that happens when you provide enough
technical resources to your technical writers and trust them to do the right
thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Update</em>: MarkDoc even received <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/05/19/markdoc">John Gruber&rsquo;s endorsement</a>. That&rsquo;s quite an
achievement as Gruber is renowned for dismissing most Markdown extensions.</p>

      <description>One of my pet peeves has always been the many different, sometimes very original ways in which CLI tools handle help requests. POSIX sets the canon: -h or --help is how we ask for help. But no, some tools1 want to be original at the worst moment: when their users are struggling, looking for guidance.
It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat consolatory to learn that I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in this fight. The other day I landed on Clayton Craft&amp;rsquo;s blog.</description>

concludes with the following assessment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you know your user is asking for help, show them the damn help. It serves
no one to chide them for not guessing the specific way your app wants them to
ask for help. Better yet, support a more &ldquo;common&rdquo; way to allow users to ask
for help if your app doesn&rsquo;t already.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went back to my library to check the year of my original <em>Neuromancer</em> edition.
It&rsquo;s 1993. For some context, I was 23 back then, with my software company
founded only a couple of years earlier. The World Wide Web was at its very
early stages. I distinctly remember getting out of that book dazed and
confused. Characters were two-dimensional at best. There was a certain lack of
exposition. The recurring streams of consciousness were complex for me to
follow<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I knew I had something powerful and innovative in my hands; I was
fascinated, but Gibson&rsquo;s writing, I think, put me off<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These musings were recently conjured by reading <em><a href="https://sabukaru.online/articles/how-neuromancer-birthed-cyberpunk">Neuromancer. The Birth of
Cyberpunk</a></em>, a fine, splendidly illustrated short essay on Gibson&rsquo;s
influence, published by Sabukaru Online (which feed I promptly added to my RSS
reader.).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Gibson penned his opening line ‘the sky above the port was the colour of
television, tuned to a dead channel’ he merged reality and the digital in
a way that seems almost prophetic today, as online footprints grow
exponentially and internet universes creep into reality. Instead of two
separate realms, there’s a ripple and blur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might re-read the novel. I&rsquo;m curious about my opinion as a senior reader.</p>

      <description>Dan Goodin at Ars Tecnica, on multifactor authentication (2FA/MFA):
Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a core defense that is among the most effective at preventing account takeovers. In addition to requiring that users provide a username and password, MFA ensures they must also use an additional factor—be it a fingerprint, physical security key, or one-time password—before they can access an account. Nothing in this article should be construed as saying MFA isn’t anything other than essential.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Goodin at Ars Tecnica, on multifactor authentication (2FA/MFA):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That said, some forms of MFA are stronger than others, and recent events show
that these weaker forms aren’t much of a hurdle for some hackers to clear. In
the past few months, suspected script kiddies like the Lapsus$ data extortion
gang and elite Russian-state threat actors (like Cozy Bear, the group behind
the SolarWinds hack) have both successfully defeated the protection.</p>

The article is solid. It first introduces the various forms of MFA, then
explains the attack vectors used to bypass them (hint: they prey on distracted,
busy, or otherwise unaware people - we&rsquo;ve all been there.) I appreciate their
stressing that MFA is essential while raising awareness of the potential
pitfalls.</p>

      <description>Quoting [Nelson&amp;rsquo;s weblog][3]:
Goodreads lost my entire account last week. Nine years as a user, some 600 books and 250 carefully written reviews all deleted and unrecoverable. Their support has not been helpful. In 35 years of being online I&amp;rsquo;ve never encountered a company with such callous disregard for their users&amp;rsquo; data.
Ouch. A lesson learned the hard way:

<p>Ouch. A lesson learned the hard way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My plan now is to host my own blog-like collection of all my reading notes

</blockquote>
<p>One of the many reasons I don&rsquo;t write my reviews on Goodreads and host them on
my website instead is precisely the risk of losing them all one day<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The same
with Twitter. I have been on Twitter since 2009 and was very active there.
I [witnessed][6] the BBS era. Since then, I&rsquo;ve seen oh-so-many &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo;
services coming and going, I could fill a book.</p>
<p>Tweeting is quicker and faster, yes. So is writing a review on Goodreads. If
I don&rsquo;t feel like opening vim to write something, though, then it&rsquo;s probably
not worth sharing in the first place.</p>
<p>Posting on Goodreads or Twitter grants more visibility, that&rsquo;s for sure.
I understand that clicking a link to leave the platform is an effort that not
everyone is willing to make. I&rsquo;m probably losing followers on Twitter and
&lsquo;friends&rsquo; on Goodreads. That&rsquo;s fine<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Those remaining are likely to be more
interested in my content and, ultimately, in me as a person.</p>
<p>Most of the stuff I write here is meant for myself anyway. If what I write
happens to also be interesting for other readers, that&rsquo;s cool, but it&rsquo;s not the
primary goal. I feel much better now that I own my content. The switch from
social media content production to [POSSE][4] was beneficial and is something
I advise everyone to do.</p>

      <description>In 2014, James Somers sat down to write a beautiful, entertaining lament about the state of today’s dictionaries and an argument in favor of the adoption of Noah Webster’s 1913 edition.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want you to conclude that it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes, Webster&amp;rsquo;s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. They&amp;rsquo;re so much better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm&amp;rsquo;s length from the actual language.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2014, James Somers sat down to write a beautiful, entertaining lament about
the state of today’s dictionaries and an argument in favor of the adoption of
Noah Webster’s 1913 edition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to conclude that it&rsquo;s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes,
Webster&rsquo;s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. They&rsquo;re so much
better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm&rsquo;s
length from the actual language.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Recall that the New Oxford, for the word &ldquo;fustian,&rdquo; gives &ldquo;pompous or
pretentious speech or writing.&rdquo; I said earlier that that wasn&rsquo;t even really
correct. Here, then, is Webster&rsquo;s definition: &ldquo;An inflated style of writing;
a kind of writing in which high-sounding words are used, above the dignity of
the thoughts or subject; bombast.&rdquo; Do you see the difference? What makes
fustian fustian is not just that the language is pompous—it&rsquo;s that this
pomposity is above the dignity of the thoughts or subject. It&rsquo;s using fancy
language where fancy language isn&rsquo;t called for. It&rsquo;s a subtle difference, but
that&rsquo;s the whole point: English is an awfully subtle instrument. A dictionary
that ignores these little shades is dangerous; in fact in those cases it&rsquo;s
worse than useless. It&rsquo;s misleading, deflating. It divests those words of their
worth and purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read it all <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">here</a>. It&rsquo;s worth your
time..</p>
<p>Not happy with the essay alone, he also added instructions on installing
Webster&rsquo;s on a Mac. Unfortunately, I could not get them to work on Catalina:
the DictUnifier app would crash as soon as I dragged the [dictionary file][4]
on it. A little research revealed that DictUnifier has a [problem with
Catalina][2]. The suggested workarounds did not work for me. In the process,
I learned that DictUnifier has gone unmaintained. Thankfully, a couple of years
ago a good soul released [DictConv][3], a &ldquo;Node.js version of DictUnifier&rdquo;.
DictConv did the trick. Webster&rsquo;s 1913 is now happily residing in my macOS
Dictionary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thom [Yorke]&rsquo;s band had a keyboard player — [whom] I think they didn&rsquo;t get on
with because he played his keyboard so loud. And so when I got the chance to
play with them, the first thing I did was make sure my keyboard was turned
off &hellip; I must have done months of rehearsals with them with this keyboard,
and they didn&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d already turned it off.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They made quite a racket, quite a noise. It was all guitars and distortion
— and so I would pretend to play for weeks on end and Thom would say, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t quite hear what you&rsquo;re doing, but I think you&rsquo;re adding a really
interesting texture, because I can tell when you&rsquo;re not playing.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m
thinking, &ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t, because I&rsquo;m really not playing.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;d go home in
the evening and work out how to actually play chords and cautiously over the
next few months, I would start turning this keyboard up. And that&rsquo;s how
I started in with Radiohead.</p>

      <description>Chelsea Wald in Nature:
Scientists say that urine diversion would have huge environmental and public-health benefits if deployed on a large scale around the world. That’s in part because urine is rich in nutrients that, instead of polluting water bodies, could go towards fertilizing crops or feed into industrial processes. According to Simha’s estimates, humans produce enough urine to replace about one-quarter of current nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers worldwide; it also contains potassium and many micronutrients (see ‘What’s in urine’).</description>

      <description>One of my recent discoveries is A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry by Bret Devereaux, an historian who&amp;rsquo;s been posting great content over the years. His Fireside Fridays, for example, provide intriguing musings on varied topics. In this week instalment, professor Devereaux takes on the different applications of blockchain technology as seen from a historian&amp;rsquo;s perspective.
Really, this is less about the technologies themselves and more about the nature of states.</description>

Bret Devereaux, an historian who&rsquo;s been posting great content over the years.
His Fireside Fridays, for example, provide intriguing musings on varied topics.
In this week instalment, professor Devereaux takes on the different
applications of blockchain technology as seen from a historian&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Really, this is less about the technologies themselves and more about the nature of states.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because while I can offer no real opinion as to if any of these new
technologies will succeed in their technical objectives [&hellip;], proponents of
these technologies typically envisage them eventually producing large social
effects, in particular they imagine that blockchain technology will create an
economic and social space outside of the control of the state, traditional
banking institutions or society at large. And here is a space where
a historian’s expertise is valuable and also almost completely lacking among
blockchain enthusiasts.</p>

      <description>A very touching Akhil Sharma in The New Yorker:
Not long after we began dating, my now wife, Christine, and I started making up stories about the child we might have.
We named the child—or, in the stories we told about him, he named himself—Suzuki Noguchi. Among the things we liked about him was that he was cheerfully indifferent to us. He did not wish to be either Irish (like Christine) or Indian (like me).</description>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We named the child—or, in the stories we told about him, he named
himself—Suzuki Noguchi. Among the things we liked about him was that he was
cheerfully indifferent to us. He did not wish to be either Irish (like
Christine) or Indian (like me). Suzuki was eight, and he chose this name
because he was into Japanese high fashion. When we told him that he couldn’t
just go around claiming to be Japanese, Suzuki said that he was a child of
God and who were we to say that God was not Japanese. In addition to being
a dandy, Suzuki was a criminal. He dealt in yellowcake uranium and trafficked
in endangered animals. Sometimes we asked him how his day at school had gone
and he would warn, “Do you really want to be an accessory after the fact?” We
imagined him banging on our bedroom door when we were having sex and
shouting, “Stop! You can’t get any child better than me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My wife was forty-eight and I was forty-seven, and we started inventing these
stories as a form of play. It also soothed some hurt part of us.</p>

      <description>I had a hunch that old songs were taking over music streaming platforms—but even I was shocked when I saw the most recent numbers. According to MRC Data, old songs now represent 70% of the US music market. Those who make a living from new music—especially that endangered species known as the working musician—have to look at these figures with fear and trembling. But the news gets worse.
I can&amp;rsquo;t say I can relate as my kids of ages 21, 18, and 16 do their best to stay clear from the music I like, but anyways, Ted Gioia&amp;rsquo;s latest piece on recent music trends is super-interesting.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s now old news that the James Webb Telescope was successfully launched on Christmas Day. But last Saturday marked another historic moment for this incredible human artifact:
After a quarter-century of effort by tens of thousands of people, more than $10 billion in taxpayer funding, and some 350 deployment mechanisms that had to go just so, the James Webb Space Telescope fully unfurled its wings. The massive spacecraft completed its final deployments, and, by God, the process went smoothly.</description>

<p>Ars Technica&rsquo;s Eric Berger has long been my go-to pusher for space-related

almost always the result of no-bullshit joint efforts by multiple international
actors.</p>

      <description>An excellent article on Web3 has just appeared on Moxie Marlinspike&amp;rsquo;s website. Being Moxie1, he&amp;rsquo;s not just speculating and rambling about stuff. In an attempt to learn more about the so-called Web3 and the technologies around it, he went all-in and built a couple of dApps himself. Then, he produced an NFT and put it up for sale. What he found is, well, to put it mildly, fascinating.
Some of his insights on technology are also interesting.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An excellent article on Web3 has <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">just appeared</a> on Moxie Marlinspike&rsquo;s
website. Being Moxie<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, he&rsquo;s not just speculating and rambling about stuff.
In an attempt to learn more about the so-called Web3 and the technologies
around it, he went all-in and built a couple of dApps himself. Then, he
produced an NFT and put it up for sale. What he found is, well, to put it
mildly, fascinating.</p>
<p>Some of his insights on technology are also interesting. For example, on
distributed vs. centralized systems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A protocol moves much more slowly than a platform. After 30+ years, email is
still unencrypted; meanwhile WhatsApp went from unencrypted to full e2ee in
a year. People are still trying to standardize sharing a video reliably over
IRC; meanwhile, Slack lets you create custom reaction emoji based on your
face. This isn’t a funding issue. If something is truly decentralized, it
becomes very difficult to change, and often remains stuck in time. That is
a problem for technology, because the rest of the ecosystem is moving very
quickly, and if you don’t keep up you will fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His point on the urgency to reduce the burden of building software is also
poignant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point, software projects require an enormous amount of human effort.
Even relatively simple apps require a group of people to sit in front of
a computer for eight hours a day, every day, forever. This wasn’t always the
case, and there was a time when 50 people working on a software project
wasn’t considered a “small team.” As long as software requires such concerted
energy and so much highly specialized human focus, I think it will have the
tendency to serve the interests of the people sitting in that room every day
rather than what we may consider our broader goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My foray into cryptocurrencies and blockchain happened almost ten years ago
when the craze started. After a few experiments, I tagged it all as a nerds
game and moved away. Moxie&rsquo;s article served me well in catching up on the whole
scene. Can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m thrilled by what I see.</p>

      <description>When The Digital Antiquarian released his System Shock retrospective earlier this year, I was in awe. System Shock was one of my favorite games back in the day, and yes, in the quarrel between id Software&amp;rsquo;s DOOM and Looking Glass&amp;rsquo;s System Shock, I was siding with the latter. I was so much more for immersion and storyline than shoot &amp;rsquo;em-ups. The Antiquarian article is excellent. If you&amp;rsquo;re into gaming history or, really, into computer&amp;rsquo;s history, I urge you to read it all.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When The Digital Antiquarian released his <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/03/system-shock/">System Shock retrospective</a>
earlier this year, I was in awe. System Shock was one of my favorite games back
in the day, and yes, in the quarrel between id Software&rsquo;s DOOM and Looking
Glass&rsquo;s System Shock, I was siding with the latter. I was so much more for
immersion and storyline than shoot &rsquo;em-ups. The Antiquarian article is
excellent. If you&rsquo;re into gaming history or, really, into computer&rsquo;s history,
I urge you to read it all.</p>
<p>As I read Maher&rsquo;s post, I thought it would be great to fetch the original
System Shock box from my sparse collection of now ancient video games and keep
it by my side as I kept reading (I am known for lending myself to such romantic
gestures.) I reached for the bookshelf. Microprose&rsquo;s Falcon 3.0 was there along
with Origin&rsquo;s Ultima VII Serpent Isle and a few others, but System Shock was
missing. It was released in 1994. I was 24. A lot of time has passed since
then, but heck, I was sure I bought that game at the time. I have fond memories
of many thrilling nights exploring the SHODAN-controlled space station. In the
following days, I spent quite some time rummaging through all my belongings:
bookshelves, drawers, garage shelves, even the cellar to no avail. The System
Shock box was lost. Along with the careless disposal of Charlie, my Commodore
64, the loss of System Shock was one of my computer griefs.</p>
<p>Then, yesterday I went to visit my parents at their place. I was with Anna, my
third kid. We were chatting about what sons and parents usually talk about on
Christmas break when my dad mentioned that he&rsquo;d been reordering stuff around
the house and that I should probably take a close look at a couple of boxes he
put aside for me. They contained old things from when I lived with them. I went
to check on them. You never know; there might be some memorabilia like the
comics or the books I used to read. Imagine my surprise when the original
System Shock box surfaced out of the first box. Oh, joy! Best Dad&rsquo;s Christmas
present ever<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/system-shock-box.JPG#center" alt="System Shock Box"  />
</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>The original price tag is still there.  In 1994, the damn thing cost a whopping 139.900 Italian Lire (€72). Pirating was wild in those days, and I won&rsquo;t negate that most of my mojo came from dark channels back then, but when a worthy game appeared, I was ready to pay homage to the authors.

      <description>Space-junkie me is back, this time reading about the innumerable opportunities that SpaceX&amp;rsquo;s Starship will offer once it becomes operational, hopefully no later than this year or the next. In his Science Upside for Starship, the exceptionally knowledgeable Casey Handmer makes a case for Starship relevance in the future of space exploration by listing an astounding number of reasonable use-cases for the vessel.
I think it is relatively straightforward to think of cool things to do with SpaceX Starships, so recent posts have focused on trying to understand the more mixed consequences for incumbent industrial organizations that are not ideally positioned to exploit the coming advances.</description>

In Born to be cool, Matthew Duffus writes about jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, reporting about his troubled life, musical prowess, influence, and legacy.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A great piece of writing on jazz has recently been posted on The Smart Set. In
<a href="https://www.thesmartset.com/born-to-be-cool/">Born to be cool</a>, Matthew Duffus writes about jazz trumpeter Chet Baker,
reporting about his troubled life, musical prowess, influence, and legacy. Some
facts are well known, like the reception and then the competition with trumpet
legends such as Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie; other tidbits are less known
(to me at least). On Baker legacy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I hope this makes clear, with Baker, music is only part of the story. In
order to fully grasp his significance within popular culture, we must also
look at the mythos surrounding him and the often less salacious truth that
lies beneath that dramatic surface. It is only by looking concurrently at
Baker’s music and image that we can truly understand why he has endured
despite the existence of more technically-gifted trumpeters and impressive
vocalists. Many such musicians came to the fore throughout his tumultuous
lifetime, but few have captured the public’s attention or endured in the way
that Baker has. For all of his limited range, not to mention the dramatic
loss of the youthful good looks that are at the root of his image, he managed
to make a living as a musician for decades and has persisted in the popular
imagination and jazz fans’ collections almost 35 years after his death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always listened to Barker with little attention, knowing and researching
little about the artist and his music. This article fills a hole. Also, I am
grateful to Duffus for letting me discover a gem like Live in Tokyo, an album
recorded on stage less than a year before his premature, tragic death and then
released posthumously. I am listening to it as I write this note, and man isn&rsquo;t
it just great.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Moka guy, always have been. Admittedly, I also like so-called American coffee and, of course, espresso. But every day at my place, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a Moka-brewed coffee. Twice. As I wake up, and then in the afternoon before getting back to work. I&amp;rsquo;ve been observing the pods frenzy spreading all around me with curiosity and bewilderment in recent years, with dedicated retailers opening (and often closing soon after) everywhere in my town.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a Moka guy, always have been. Admittedly, I also like so-called American
coffee and, of course, espresso. But every day at my place, I&rsquo;ll have
a Moka-brewed coffee. Twice. As I wake up, and then in the afternoon before
getting back to work. I&rsquo;ve been observing the pods frenzy spreading all around
me with curiosity and bewilderment in recent years, with dedicated retailers
opening (and often closing soon after) everywhere in my town. Bialetti&rsquo;s Moka
coffee pots have always been around my life. Not disposable, for they are
pretty expensive even here in Italy, but common, everyday kitchen gadgets?
Absolutely.</p>
<p>So it was interesting to read Atlas Obscura&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/make-coffee-moka-pot">The Humble Brilliance of Italy&rsquo;s
Moka Coffee Pot</a> to learn more about Moka&rsquo;s roots, history (with the ups and
downs), and design relevance. Of all this stuff, I was only marginally aware.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Moka pot is a symbol of Italy: of postwar ingenuity and global culinary
dominance. It is in the Museum of Modern Art, the Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian
Design Museum, and other temples to design. It is in the Guinness Book of
World Records as the world&rsquo;s most popular coffee maker and was for decades
commonplace to the point of ubiquity not only in Italy but in Cuba,
Argentina, Australia, and the United States. It&rsquo;s also widely misunderstood
and maligned, with approval in the modern coffee world coming perhaps a bit
too late, in only the past few years. Get one while you can.</p>

      <title>The word for web is forest</title>

      <description>When I read Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds &amp;amp; Shape Our Futures by Merlin Sheldrake1, I was stunned by the scale and importance of the mycorrhizal network that lies beneath the surface of any given forest in the world. The &amp;ldquo;wood wide web&amp;rdquo;, as scientists started to call it, sounded like the perfect metaphor for such an incredibly efficient, symbiotic relation between fungi and trees.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I read <em>Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds
&amp; Shape Our Futures</em> by Merlin Sheldrake<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I was stunned by the scale and
importance of the mycorrhizal network that lies beneath the surface of any
given forest in the world. The &ldquo;wood wide web&rdquo;, as scientists started to call
it, sounded like the perfect metaphor for such an incredibly efficient,
symbiotic relation between fungi and trees.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://newpublic.org/article/1572/the-word-for-web-is-fores://newpublic.org/article/1572/the-word-for-web-is-forest">The Word for Web is Forest</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, Claire L. Evans brilliantly reverses the
perspective. If the wood wide web metaphor holds, we can see the world wide web
as a live, intermingled network of interconnected, initially decentralized and
perhaps symbiotic entities. The issues we face in the modern web are not
dissimilar from those faced by ill forests worldwide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wood wide web has been a powerhouse metaphor for popularizing the
mutualistic relationships of healthy forests. But like a struggling forest,
the web is no longer healthy. It has been wounded and depleted in the pursuit
of profit. Going online today is not an invigorating walk through a green
woodland—it’s rush-hour traffic alongside a freeway median of diseased trees,
littered with the detritus of late capitalism. If we want to repair this
damage, we must look to the wisdom of the forest and listen to ecologists
like Simard when they tell us just how sustainable, interdependent,
life-giving systems work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suzane Simard, the Canadian ecologist who revealed the cooperative nature of
forests, explains that Mother Trees (the eldest trees) serve as &ldquo;central hubs
of the wood wide web.  They are the strongest, the most resource-rich, with
taproots stretching far beneath the earth.&rdquo; When a Mother Tree dies, it shares
its resources with the forest while many other Mothers guarantee the
continuity and integrity of the ecosystem. This used to be the case with the
Web too, but not anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The web isn’t what it used to be. When the editors of Nature compared
mycorrhizal fungi to a computer network, the web was still predominantly
peer-to-peer, its users sharing their thoughts on personal home pages and
homespun message-boards. Online advertising was in its infancy. But as the
web has centralized, it has strayed further and further from the ideal
presented by the wood wide web [..] By selecting for the most inflammatory
and emotional content, Big Tech has algorithmically weeded the forest into
a field of commercial timber.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evans then proceeds to suggest that we should probably strive to imitate
mycorrhizal networks and (re?)build decentralized networks, with &ldquo;Mother nodes
&ndash; sites in the network bearing a responsibility of care.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll stop here. Read
the <a href="https://newpublic.org/article/1572/the-word-for-web-is-fores://newpublic.org/article/1572/the-word-for-web-is-forest">article</a> now, there is a lot to absorb. She doesn&rsquo;t go into the details
of her proposed solution, but offers us an original, courageous and pregnant
point of view to consider.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We found that ageing brings about a series of inevitable losses that deeply
challenge people’s sense of connection to the world around them. Loneliness
can often be oversimplified or reduced to how many friends a person has or
how often they see their loved ones.But a particular focus for us was to
better understand what underpins feelings of loneliness in older people on
a deeper level. Researchers have used the term “existential loneliness” to
describe this deeper sense of feeling “separated from the world” – as though
there is an insurmountable gap between oneself and the rest of society. Our
objective was to listen carefully to how people experienced and responded to
this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do I have to migrate to the new hosting model</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t have to. It&rsquo;s the preferred way to host ASP.NET Core
applications from .NET 6 and onwards but you aren&rsquo;t forced to change your
project layout. This means you can upgrade from .NET 5 to .NET 6.0 by
changing the target framework in your project file from net5.0 to net6.0.</p>

<p>.NET6 Release Candidate is out, so the guide is unlikely to receive updates,
but I&rsquo;m sure that David will be ready to do so if required.</p>
<p>We are about to release several brand new web services in the coming weeks.
They are all ASP.NET 5, currently in beta, but before release we&rsquo;re likely to
upgrade them to NET6. NET6 is LTS, NET5 isn&rsquo;t, and offers significant
advantages, remarkable [performance gains][2] included.</p>

      <description>Years ago, I translated an essay by Terry Windling, On Tolkien and Fairie-Stories, from American English to Italian. I remember arguing with the author about her use of periods in quotations. Each quotation would end with a period before the closing mark. I was puzzled. We don&amp;rsquo;t do that in Italy. More importantly, I read many English texts where the period was left outside the quotation itself. She insisted that her style was correct1.</description>

<p>Today I learn that, in English, there are in fact two different and conflicting
quotation mark punctuation styles: American and British.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are different ways of combining quotation and punctuation marks. In the
American style, you almost always put periods and commas inside the quotation
marks [&hellip;] In the British style, however, you put periods and commas outside
the quotation marks, unless they are part of a complete sentence that is
fully contained between the quotation marks:</p>

Continuing on the long-established tradition, the team has also worked hard on the performance side of things. File IO, for example, is seeing impressive gains:
For .NET 6, we have made FileStream much faster and more reliable, thanks to an almost entire re-write. For same cases, the async implementation is now a few times faster!</description>

on ASP.NET 6 Minimal APIs. Continuing on the long-established tradition, the
team has also worked hard on the performance side of things. File IO, for
example, is seeing <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/file-io-improvements-in-dotnet-6/">impressive gains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For .NET 6, we have made FileStream much faster and more reliable, thanks to
an almost entire re-write. For same cases, the async implementation is now
a few times faster! We also recognized the need of having more
high-performance file IO features: concurrent reads and writes,
scatter/gather IO and introduced new APIs for them. TL;DR File I/O is better,
stronger, faster!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have the time, make sure you read the whole blog post. Learning about
the low-level details on how they achieved such (pretty phenomenal) results is
fascinating. They&rsquo;re not stopping at file IO either. In another <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-6/#is-that-all">lengthy blog
post</a>, they had to add a table of contents, or we would get lost in the myriad
of improvements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t worry, I don’t cover all of them here, but grab a large mug of your
favorite hot beverage, and settle in: this post takes a rip-roarin’ tour
through ~400 PRs that, all together, significantly improve .NET performance
for .NET 6.</p>

      <description>I stumbled upon a personal growth article this weekend, and that&amp;rsquo;s odd because I tend to stay clear from such things. Yet I found it quite relevant, so much that I thought I would share it (the delivery is also amusing, which is something new for this kind of content).
It’s just another day… and you’re just doing what you need to do. You’re getting things done, and the day moves forward in this continuous sequence of checklists, actions, and respites.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I stumbled upon a personal growth article this weekend, and that&rsquo;s odd because
I tend to stay clear from such things. Yet I found it quite relevant, so much
that I thought I would <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/travel-is-no-cure-for-the-mind-e449d3109d71">share it</a> (the delivery is also amusing, which is
something new for this kind of content).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s just another day… and you’re just doing what you need to do. You’re
getting things done, and the day moves forward in this continuous sequence of
checklists, actions, and respites. But at various moments of your routine,
you pause and take a good look at your surroundings. The scenes of your
everyday life. The blur of this all-too-familiar film. And you can’t help but
to wonder… If there is more to it all. For some reason — this country, this
city, this neighborhood, this particular street — is the place you are living
a majority of your life in. And it is this thought that allows a daydream to
seep in. You start thinking of all the other places you could be in this
world. Or more accurately, all the places you’d rather be in. Somewhere more
exciting. Somewhere new. Somewhere that can provide experiences that are
foreign to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I agree with the article, I&rsquo;d also mention that travel or putting some
distance from the Box of Daily Experience, as the author calls it, is a great
way to appreciate what we leave behind; to re-evaluate it from a different
perspective.</p>
<p>As I read the article, I kept thinking, this is not particularly original;
I read something like this before. Then, by the end of the piece, a note tells
us that the text is, in fact, an adaptation of Seneca&rsquo;s letter to Lucilius on
the subject of travel. Seneca&rsquo;s moral letters to Lucilius are just pure
awesomeness.</p>

      <title>Finland&#39;s intriguing take on the homelessness problem</title>

      <description>In Finland, the number of homeless people has fallen sharply. The reason: The country applies the “Housing First” concept. Those affected by homelessness receive a small apartment and counselling – without any preconditions. 4 out of 5 people affected thus make their way back into a stable life. And: All this is cheaper than accepting homelessness.
Finland&amp;rsquo;s take on the homelessness problem is remarkable and gives hope. I live in a small town where the problem is not as apparent as in, say, San Francisco.</description>

<p>Finland&rsquo;s <a href="https://scoop.me/housing-first-finland-homelessness/">take on the homelessness problem</a> is remarkable and gives hope.
I live in a small town where the problem is not as apparent as in, say, San
Francisco. Whenever I think back to my short time in San Francisco, I shudder
at the terrifying homelessness situation I met there. There, in San Francisco,
I realized the magnitude of &ldquo;true liberalism&rdquo;&rsquo;s failure.</p>

      <title>On GitHub Copilot</title>

      <description>Like everyone else on the planet, I&amp;rsquo;ve been following GitHub Copilot since its launch. It is an impressive achievement and a remarkable milestone for the deep learning industry, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure. We are obviously at the early stages in deep learning applied to software development, and it is somewhat unsettling to ponder what the future might hold in this field.
Like many others, however, I worry about code quality issues and the risk of license infringements1.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like everyone else on the planet, I&rsquo;ve been following <a href="https://copilot.github.com/">GitHub Copilot</a> since
its launch. It is an impressive achievement and a remarkable milestone for the
deep learning industry, that&rsquo;s for sure. We are obviously at the early stages
in deep learning applied to software development, and it is somewhat unsettling
to ponder what the future might hold in this field.</p>
<p>Like many others, however, I worry about code quality issues and the risk of
license infringements<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I am also concerned that the advent of Copilot-like
tools might fundamentally change the software developer experience, if not the
software developer role as a whole, and for the worst.</p>
<p>I wrote down some notes preparing for an in-depth Copilot article, but then
I stumbled on Jeremy Howard&rsquo;s &lsquo;[Is Copilot a blessing, or a curse?][3]&rsquo;. In
that piece, Jeremy covers all of my points and then some more. Also, given his
background, Jeremy&rsquo;s musings on deep learning carry way more weight than mine.
My advice is to read his article. I especially appreciate his critique on
Copilot&rsquo;s so-advertised role as &ldquo;AI pair programmer&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GitHub markets Copilot as a “pair programmer”. But I’m not sure this really
captures what it’s doing. A good pair programmer is someone who helps you
question your assumptions, identify hidden problems, and see the bigger
picture. Copilot doesn’t do any of those things – quite the opposite, it
blindly assumes that your assumptions are appropriate and focuses entirely on
churning out code based on the immediate context of where your text cursor is
right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then mentions both <em>automation</em> and <em>anchoring</em> biases and explains how they
might influence the developers using advanced AI-powered automation tools like
Copilot.</p>
<p>The code proposed to Copilot seems to solve most problems, yes, but it appears
to average quality at best. Jeremy explains why: Copilot trains on public
repositories, with no filter on the overall quality of the material at hand
&ndash;something complicated to achieve, indeed. The developer is expected to
carefully review the suggestions, and that&rsquo;s where automation and anchoring
biases might affect judgment. Besides, who enjoys doing code reviews?
I certainly don&rsquo;t. Any day, I&rsquo;d instead take on the challenge and churn out my
own solution. Yes, it might require effort and time, or see me googling for
some help (those Stack Overflow hints have usually been reviewed, amended and
commented on by fellow programmers; both quality <em>and</em> review, right there).
When my solution works, I am thrilled. That feel of self-accomplishment and
satisfaction is what I enjoy the most. It&rsquo;s what I look forward to in the
morning when I sit at my desk.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t want to renounce deep understanding. When we delegate code
creation, we&rsquo;re taking a step toward shallow knowledge in our field. Eric
Sink&rsquo;s &lsquo;[Will deep understanding still be valuable?][4]&rsquo; has an excellent
discussion around this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my nearly 4 decades of writing code, I have consistently found that the
most valuable thing is to know how things work. Nothing in software
development is more effective than the ability to see deeper. [&hellip;] I am
utterly convinced that deep understanding is important. But increasingly,
I feel like I&rsquo;m swimming upstream. It seems like most people in our industry
care far more about &ldquo;how to do&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;how does it work&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Copilot is great and feels like magic<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. And precisely for that reason, at my
company, we&rsquo;re not going to adopt it.</p>

      <description>A long-sought first draft of Marcel Proust&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;In Search of Lost Time&amp;rsquo; surfaced a few years ago. Its fascinating story and intriguing news are revealed in a Tablet article titled Proust&amp;rsquo;s Madeleine Was Originally a Slice Toast.
Being the Tablet &amp;ldquo;a daily online magazine of Jewish news, ideas, and culture&amp;rdquo;, it makes sense that a good part of the article focuses on Proust&amp;rsquo;s ambivalence about his Jewishness. Still, there are many other interesting tidbits to be learned.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A long-sought first draft of Marcel Proust&rsquo;s &lsquo;In Search of Lost Time&rsquo; surfaced
a few years ago. Its fascinating story and intriguing news are revealed in
a Tablet article titled <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/proust-madeleine-antisemitism-jewishness">Proust&rsquo;s Madeleine Was Originally a Slice Toast</a>.</p>
<p>Being the Tablet &ldquo;a daily online magazine of Jewish news, ideas, and culture&rdquo;,
it makes sense that a good part of the article focuses on Proust&rsquo;s ambivalence
about his Jewishness. Still, there are many other interesting tidbits to be
learned. On the novel itself and its development, on some relevant characters
and their real-world counterparts, and Proust himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of these matters, as is natural in early drafts, differ from the final
versions: the iconic madeleine in these pages is the far more prosaic toast.
Sound, not just taste or the narrator’s position standing on cobblestones, is
added to the battery of things that can revive the past. Proust writes here,
after trying in vain to resuscitate a lost day of his youth, that &ldquo;I let my
spoon fall onto my plate. There was then produced exactly the same sound as
that of the hammer of the brakemen who that day struck the wheels of the
train at its stop. At that same moment the burning and blinded hour when this
noise rang out was revived for me …&rdquo; Perhaps most surprisingly, the Narrator,
here given his actual name, has a younger brother, an annoying one to boot,
who &ldquo;though only five-and-a-half years-old, was of a rather violent nature.&rdquo;</p>

      <description>Sam Enright assembled a friendly Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Miles Davis. If you&amp;rsquo;ve always been curious about jazz but never really managed to get into it, then this resource might serve as a good starting point. I cannot say I&amp;rsquo;m one hundred per cent aligned with his choices, but we&amp;rsquo;re close. One remarkable statement I concur with is this one:

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Enright assembled a friendly <a href="https://samenright.com/2021/06/06/a-beginners-guide-to-miles-davis/">Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Miles Davis</a>. If
you&rsquo;ve always been curious about jazz but never really managed to get into it,
then this resource might serve as a good starting point. I cannot say I&rsquo;m one
hundred per cent aligned with his choices, but we&rsquo;re close. One remarkable
statement I concur with is this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jazz is so interesting to me because of its fusion of intricate underlying
structure with improvisation and spontaneity. As Ken Burns put it, jazz is
“familiar, but brand new every night”. Moreover, I enjoy the intellectual
demandingness of jazz as a genre. Jazz musicians seem to be the most
thoughtful and intelligent of any genre. Many of the more Avant Garde songs
mentioned in this post don’t sound good unless you’re really concentrating.
Some of it sounds cacophonous to a newcomer. This is why jazz is considerably
more difficult to get into than other genres and has a lack of listenership
among the youth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sam put a lot of effort into his selection, and it shows. Should his list be
overwhelming for you, my shortcut advice would be: listen to Kind of Blue,
especially the first two tracks, So What and Freddie Freeloader. If they don&rsquo;t
move you, I am sorry, you&rsquo;re probably not a jazz person.</p>

      <description>The article I&amp;rsquo;m linking today is authored by Aaron Stannard and focuses on the drama currently going on in the .NET Open Source ecosystem. We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there. A dependency we took aeons ago goes unmaintained or changes its licensing model. Why does this happen? Because at some point, projects need to become sustainable or else they fail.
[&amp;hellip;] it&amp;rsquo;s inexpensive for maintainers to support a small number of users with relatively similar demands - but once a project achieves critical mass and the demand on the maintainers exceeds their desire to supply, something will have to give.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The article I&rsquo;m linking today is authored by Aaron Stannard and focuses on <a href="https://aaronstannard.com/dotnetoss-free-lunch-ends/">the
drama currently going on in the .NET Open Source ecosystem</a>. We&rsquo;ve all been
there. A dependency we took aeons ago goes unmaintained or changes its
licensing model. Why does this happen? Because at some point, projects need to
become sustainable or else they fail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] it&rsquo;s inexpensive for maintainers to support a small number of users
with relatively similar demands - but once a project achieves critical mass
and the demand on the maintainers exceeds their desire to supply, something
will have to give.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Case in point, IdentityServer. The license change was, in my opinion, long
overdue. The new agreement is very reasonable; the package remains free for
most users. I understand the so-called &ldquo;Procurement Rage.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] once maintainers affix a dollar amount as the entry fee to benefit from
all of their institutionalized knowledge and expertise developers now have no
choice other than violating the license terms (legal won&rsquo;t stand for that) or
dealing with the procurement bureaucracy to allocate company money for the
purchase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Procurement is undoubtedly an obstacle to open-source adoption within the
Enterprise. Yet, it is true that there is no such a thing as a free lunch.
Either be prepared to pay or send some value back to your dependencies, in one
form or another (the article lists several great options). The conclusion is
just perfect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creating virtuous cycles where you continuously exchange value with OSS
producers is the inevitable conclusion to the “Open Source Sustainability
Crisis” - and everyone will be better off for it. So you should start the
conversation with your team and find some projects to support - because it’s
in your own self-interest to see them sustained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I subscribe to every single word. I find this case even more disheartening
because most protesters are asking Microsoft to roll their own alternative. No
gratitude or sympathy, nothing, really, for the people who worked hard for
years, covering complex and strategic subjects such as authentication and
authorization, providing excellent value for free.  Baby-crying and asking
Microsoft to &ldquo;solve the problem&rdquo; is so sad. It&rsquo;s also so typical of certain
Enterprise culture. They just don&rsquo;t understand open-source or, just for
convenience, they pretend not to get it.</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that there already exist some valid, open-source,
IdentityServer alternatives (IS4 included.) These should be the default go-to
solution for those who abandon ship. The last thing we need is yet another
&ldquo;official&rdquo; package by the behemoth. If anything, we need more variance,
certainly not less.</p>

      <description>Trade Wars 2002 was a great 1991 online game I hosted on one of my BBSes back in the day. Not sure if it was Lorien or Phoenix BBS; it might have been the latter given the game&amp;rsquo;s release date. I totally forgot TW2002 until yesterday when I spotted this 1991: Trade Wars 2002 article on the 50 Years of Text Games newsletter.
I humbly confess that, until yesterday, I never made the obvious connection between TW2002 and Eve Online.</description>

</p>
<p>I humbly confess that, until yesterday, I never made the obvious connection
between TW2002 and Eve Online. That&rsquo;s quite startling considering that I&rsquo;ve
been a beta player first and then an avid Eve player for a few years (Eve was
also the last game I seriously played on a computer.)</p>
<p>In retrospect, what&rsquo;s surprising is that Station Interaction, possibly the best
trait of TW2002, never really made it to Eve Online (not in my playing
timeframe, at least).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The StarDock was a key addition to Martin’s version of the game that went
a long way toward making its galaxy feel more like a dynamic, living place.
It’s filled with things to do: shop, gamble, visit a theatre to watch
ASCII-art sci-fi parody “movies” (short animations) with titles like Vulcan
Thunder. But more interesting are the chances for community interaction. The
StarDock’s tavern provides a range of different ways to interact with fellow
players: among other options, you can pay credits to post a public message
that everyone will see, add to the graffiti scrawled on the bathroom wall, or
pay a “grimy Trader” in the back room to learn information about other
players, such as what sector their ship was last seen in. The grimy trader
could share a huge selection of hints and useful info about the game state,
provided you could think of the right things to ask him about and had the
credits to pay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The StarDock also holds secrets: the large menu of available commands doesn’t
show all the options available. Pressing a key not listed on the menu would
describe your character exploring the seedier, lesser-known parts of the
station. A particular unlisted key would lead you to a locked door and a secret
password which, once learned—from the grimy Trader, perhaps, or another
player—admits you to the Underground, where nefarious players can buy illicit
goods and coordinate against law-abiding Federation forces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eve was (probably still is) a fantastic concept. I was Jexter the Caldari. With
my friend Fist, we founded a small roleplaying space-pirate group known as
Jokers. Back in our time, I think <a href="https://oldforums.eveonline.com/?a=topic&amp;threadID=356966">we made the news</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/eve-online-space-station.png" alt="Eve&amp;rsquo;s Online 2009 Space Station"  />
</p>
<p>But what we found always missing was space station interaction. Besides
a generic system-wide chat, nothing encouraged players to spend time (and
roleplay!) while their ships were docked at those stunning space stations.
That&rsquo;s something TW2002 nailed down to near perfection. I wish Eve had that. It
could have kept me in the game for far longer.</p>

      <description>My brilliant friend Salvatore Sanfilippo (otherwise known as antirez of Redis fame) has an interesting write-up on his website. How similar is programming to prose writing? After getting his own feet wet with novel writing, he is convinced that the two activities share many common traits.
One year ago I paused my programming life and started writing a novel, with the illusion that my new activity was deeply different than the previous one.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My brilliant friend Salvatore Sanfilippo (otherwise known as antirez of Redis
fame) has an interesting write-up on <a href="http://antirez.com/news/135">his website</a>. How similar is
programming to prose writing? After getting his own feet wet with novel
writing, he is convinced that the two activities share many common traits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One year ago I paused my programming life and started writing a novel, with
the illusion that my new activity was deeply different than the previous one.
A river of words later, written but more often rewritten, I’m pretty sure of
the contrary: programming big systems and writing novels have many common
traits and similar processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a worthy read. I especially appreciate his conclusions on what
programming can actually learn from writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe programming, in this regard, can learn something from writing: when
writing the first core of a new system, when the original creator is still
alone, isolated, able to do anything, she should pretend that this first core
is her only bullet. During the genesis of the system she should rewrite this
primitive kernel again and again, in order to find the best possible design. My
hypothesis is that this initial design will greatly inform what will happen
later: growing organically something that has a good initial structure will
result in a better system, even after years of distance from the original
creation, and even if the original core was just a tiny faction of the future
mass the system would eventually assume.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect that his line of reasoning might be influenced by some sort
of confirmation bias<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.  We are inclined to notice similarities between our
own activities, especially so when we perform them passionately. While common
patterns emerge naturally, differences, even remarkable ones, tend to go
unnoticed.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

<li id="fn:1">
<p>The term <em>confirmation bias</em> is probably misused in this context. I am sure there is a better definition; it just eludes me and my own ignorance.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For decades Scandinavian countries have been renowned for their educational
systems, low levels of corruption, sustainable economy, social justice, overall
quality of life. According to <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/04/finland-happiness-lagom-hygge.html">Jukka Savolainen on Slate</a>, the reason why
Finns have now been dominating the World Happiness Report four years in a row
has little to do with these factors and more with their life expectations.</p>
<p>Savolainen perspective is interesting because he is a Finn living in the US. He
experienced the Scandinavian system first hand, then moved to a (very)
different culture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nordic ethos stands in particularly stark contrast to the American
culture characterized by &ldquo;extreme emphasis upon the accumulation of wealth as
a symbol of success,&rdquo; as observed by the sociologist Robert K. Merton in the
1930s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In comparing the different lifestyles, he also touches on the social
differences. Scandinavian people are not famous for their openness or the
quality of their small talk, that&rsquo;s for sure. I do admire their low-aspirations
attitude, which is well described in the article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, they embrace a cultural orientation that sets realistic limits to
one&rsquo;s expectations for a good life. [&hellip;] People are socialized to believe
that what they have is as good as it gets—or close enough. This mindset
explains why Finns are the happiest people in the world despite living in
small apartments, earning modest incomes—with even more limited purchasing
power thanks to high prices and taxes—and, unlike Iceland, having never even
made it to the World Cup!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have always been fascinated by the North. When I went to Stockholm to present
at Pycon Sweden, I fell in love with the city. I was lucky, though. We were in
May, and the weather was beautiful all week. Daylight lasted until midnight. To
my enthusiasm, the locals objected I should come back in the winter season to
really appreciate what living in the North entails. As a Mediterranean guy,
I imagine I might soon feel the long for warmer climates and still, the dream
of moving North persists.</p>

      <description>Consider the 10x10 grids of green and white boxes below. How would you make them symmetrical? Most people would add green boxes to the emptier half of the grid rather than remove them from the fuller half. Even when the latter would have been more efficient.

</p>
<p>The case, along with a similar problem revolving around the stability of
a peculiar lego structure, is reported by an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00592-0">intriguing Nature article</a> on
the topic of psychology and human behaviour. The paper linked to the piece
demonstrates that people consistently consider changes that add components over
those that subtract them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the implications of Adams and colleagues’ findings? There are many
real-world consequences of failing to consider that situations can often be
improved by removing rather than adding. For instance, when people feel
dissatisfied with the decor of their home, they might address the situation
by going on a spending spree and acquiring more furniture — even if it would
be equally effective to get rid of a cluttering coffee table.  [&hellip;] On
a grander scale, the favouring of additive solutions by individual
decision-makers might contribute to problematic societal phenomena, such as
the increasing expansion of formal organizations4 and the near-universal but
environmentally unsustainable quest for economic growth. (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00592-0">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the innate tendency to favour additive solutions contributing to the entropy
of the software systems we build? And if so, isn&rsquo;t over-engineering, the
scarecrow of software systems,  its most apparent consequence? I&rsquo;m in no way an
expert in human behaviour and its implications in software engineering. Still,
my bet is on a hard yes on both questions.</p>

      <description>What a fascinating read. It sits right at the intersection of two of my (too many) vicious interests: Jazz music and books.
Since the mid-1970s, almost every jazz musician has owned a copy of the same book. It has a peach-colored cover, a chunky, 1970s-style logo, and a black plastic binding. It’s delightfully homemade-looking—like it was printed by a bunch of teenagers at a Kinkos. And inside is the sheet music for hundreds of common jazz tunes—also known as jazz “standards”—all meticulously notated by hand.</description>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But if you were going to music school in the 1970s, you couldn’t just buy
a copy of the Real Book at the campus bookstore. Because the Real Book… was
illegal. The world’s most popular collection of Jazz music was a totally
unlicensed publication. It was a self-published book created without
permission from music publishers or songwriters. It was duplicated at
photocopy shops and sold on street corners, out of the trunks of cars, and
under the table at music stores where people used secret code words to make
the exchange. The full story of how the Real Book came to be this bootleg
bible of jazz is a complicated one. It’s a story about what happens when an
insurgent, improvisational art form like Jazz gets codified and becomes
something that you can learn from a book.</p>

tidy like that the whole workday. It must feel so good.</p>
<p>I try to keep my windows well arranged. The typical setup might be two windows,
from two different apps, tiled side by side. Maybe the browser, or Postman, on
the right, and my favourite editor on the left. Stuff like that.</p>
<p><a href="https://hookshot.app/">Hookshot</a> is excellent for doing just that. I discovered this tiny little
app a few weeks ago, thanks to <a href="https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/hookshot">Robin Rendle</a>. Before, I was using Moom,
which is also good. I like Hookshot&rsquo;s dead-simple keyboard shortcuts. Once the
single modifier key combo <em>Control+Command</em> clicks, you&rsquo;re done. Rearranging
windows becomes a no-brainer. In a way, the experience reminds me of Vim and
its unique muscle-memory superpower. The ten days trial ended today, and
I purchased the license right away.</p>

comes at peace with that, acknowledges ignorance, and, more importantly,
understands when it&rsquo;s worth digging deeper. In other words:</p>

<p>Being a senior developer is less about knowing absolutely everything and more

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://catern.com/services.html">Write libraries instead of services</a> is an interesting article I read
a while ago. I cannot get it off my head. In an attempt to clear up my mind,
I decided to sit down and write about it. I have been writing libraries for
a good part of my life. Most of my earlier dev-work resides on thousands of
computers in the form of libraries. More recently, I have been writing and
deploying remote services. Libraries versus Services is a topic I care about.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s jump into the article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A service has constant administration costs which are paid by the service
provider. A properly designed library instead moves these costs to the users
of the library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ignores the issue of support. You are going to have to support your users.
Support comes at a cost. I would argue that, given the distributed nature of
libraries, supporting them can become <em>very</em> costly. Your library is probably
residing in a myriad of diverse, local environments. Issues are hard to
replicate or reason about. It is hard to isolate your own code from the
surrounding environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People say, &ldquo;services are easy because you can upgrade them centrally, so you
can avoid slow-to-upgrade users making everyone&rsquo;s lives worse.&rdquo; But this
assumes that slow-to-upgrade users can have negative effects on everyone
else. If one user can&rsquo;t have a negative impact on other users, then you don&rsquo;t
care if some users are slow to upgrade; they&rsquo;re only hurting themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, support. Those slow-to-upgrade users are going to not just hurt but
torture your support service with years-old obsolete issues.  If you think it&rsquo;s
the user&rsquo;s responsibility to keep dependencies up to date, good luck with that.
That assumes that developers adopting the library control their deployments,
which isn&rsquo;t often the case. They might employ the library in a desktop
application distributed to dozens (or thousands) of end-users. It could be next
to impossible for them to make sure that all their deployments are up to speed.
Old versions are a pain point and one (if not the most) significant cost
factor. Maintaining a service comes at a cost too, and you&rsquo;ll likely need to
offer some sort of support there as well. A service, however, ensures that all
your users are on the same version, which tremendously reduces the support
effort.</p>
<p>When weighting costs, support must be factored in, along with all the rest:
development, maintenance, distribution, documentation, etc.  Maybe the
article&rsquo;s author has the luxury of not having to deal with support himself.
Still, there&rsquo;s someone else at his company who has to do that.</p>
<p>A service, on the other hand, represents a single point of failure. If it goes
down, all users are immediately affected<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. By contrast, a nasty bug in your
library will only affect the unlucky users on that version. Now, <em>this</em> makes
a significant advantage for distributed libraries.</p>
<p>Your service, however, will talk to all languages via REST, GraphQL, or any
other interface of choice. The library will usually speak just one language.
Yes, you might provide language-specific SDKs for your service, but that&rsquo;s just
an option.</p>
<p>Do you need to hold state? If you do, most of the time, a service will be
a better option. With state comes responsibility, however. You have to
ensure regular backups, resilience, and maintenance, all of them at a cost.</p>
<p>The author suggests a few approaches to circumventing library limitations. Some
are reasonable, like dynamic linking where it is applicable (not all stacks
support it). Others, quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Many factors influence the choice between service and library, use case and
prevailing circumstances being the main ones. I am not even sure they are
comparable, as they tend to solve different problems.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>I know first hand. We&rsquo;ve recently been impacted by a catastrophic event that happened to one of our providers. Our services went down and, with them, a good part of our users. How we overcame the situation and what we learned in the process would probably be worth telling, maybe in a future article.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

better, faster, stronger&rdquo;, yes, but hardly a revolution.</p>
<p>My pusher of digital memorabilia is Jimmy Maher, also known as [The Digital
Antiquarian][5]. One month ago, he wrote a [fantastic article][3] on Origin&rsquo;s
Ultima VIII Pagan. Then, just the other day, he doubled down with a [terrific
piece][4] on Looking Glass&rsquo; System Shock. Both are games I played fervidly<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Maher is not kind to Pagan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But then, for the eighth game in the mainline Ultima series, Origin decided
to try something just a little bit different. They made a game in which you
played a thoughtless jerk moving on rails through a linear series of events;
in which you never went to Britannia at all, but stayed instead on
a miserable hellhole of a world called Pagan; in which you spent the whole
game adventuring alone (after all, who would want to adventure with a jerk
like you?); in which the core mechanics were jumping between pedestals like
Super Mario and pounding your enemies over the head with your big old hammer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It hurts to admit it, but he&rsquo;s exactly right. Nonetheless, I enjoyed exploring
Pagan&rsquo;s world. When I later joined the Ultima Online Beta, it was amazing to
see that the same graphic engine and all of Pagan&rsquo;s art were recycled.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/system-shock.jpg#right" alt="System Shock"  />

System Shock was a game I loved. I found it to be revolutionary. Games like
this one were precisely the kind of entertainment I strived for: immersive
simulations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] Moving through said spaces, picking up bits and pieces of the horrible
events which have unfolded there, quickly becomes highly unnerving. The sense
of embodied realism that clings to every aspect of the game is key to the
sense of genuine, oppressive fear it creates in its player. Tellingly,
Looking Glass liked to call System Shock a “simulation,” even though it
simulates nothing that has ever existed in the real world. The word is rather
shorthand for its absolute commitment to the truth — fictional truth, yes,
but truth nevertheless — of the world it drops you into.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have always been a System Shock guy more than a DOOM person. I really like
how Maher compares the two games and the software companies that produced them,
more or less in the same time-span<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In Maher&rsquo;s reconstructions, what I find to be more appealing is not the games
themselves with their mechanics but rather the history behind them. How the
dev-team conceived and then developed their projects.</p>
<p>After so many years, I am thankful to Maher for bringing these two games back
to memory. Now, I am impatiently waiting for his Ultima Online installment.
I know it <em>must</em> be on his list, right?</p>

      <title>How to Write Good Software Documentation</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2021 07:05:25 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/how-to-write-good-software-documentation/</guid>
      <description>There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software documentation: there isn’t one thing called documentation, there are four. They are: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. They represent four different purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their creation. Understanding the implications of this will help improve most documentation - often immensely.
I dig Daniele Procida&amp;rsquo;s take on writing good software documentation.</description>

</blockquote>
<p>I dig Daniele Procida&rsquo;s take on <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">writing good software documentation</a>. It
just makes sense. The system is simple, comprehensive, and, crucial,
universally-applicable. The &ldquo;four different functions&rdquo; scheme works equally
well if you are writing for a technical-savvy audience or the general public,
which is excellent. The users I&rsquo;m writing for are software developers, in some
cases, and desktop or web application users in others.</p>
<p>I also like how he goes deep into explaining how and why each function has
a different goal, should be isolated and written differently from others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of them requires a <strong>distinct mode of writing</strong>. People working with
software need these four different kinds of documentation at different times,
in different circumstances - so software usually needs them all, and they
should all be integrated into your documentation. And documentation needs to
be explicitly structured around them, and they all must be kept separate and
distinct from each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last but not least, the framework itself serves as a guide for the author.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This division makes it obvious to both author and reader what material, and
what kind of material, goes where. It tells the author <strong>how to write</strong>, and
<strong>what to write</strong>, and <strong>where to write it</strong>. It saves the author from
wasting a great deal of time trying to wrestle the information they want to
impart into a shape that makes sense, because each of these kinds of
documentation has only one job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish I had this resource at hand when I was writing the docs for <a href="/opensource/">my open
source projects</a>. I think will adopt this framework on the next occasion,
which will be very soon.</p>

      <description>I discovered you can use the &amp;ldquo;diskpart&amp;rdquo; tool to compact a VHDX. This allows you to shrink a WSL2 virtual disk file, reclaiming disk space. It appeared to work for me without any data corruption, taking the file size down from 100GB to 15GB. (source)
I adore Parallels &amp;ldquo;reclaim disk space&amp;rdquo; feature. Just the other day, I got back 70GB off my Windows Guest in a breeze. I&amp;rsquo;m coming from VirtualBox, where reclaiming disk space is a significant pain.</description>

      <description>The Literary Hub has a great short interview with Ian McEwan.
What’s the best writing advice you’ve ever received?

Where many others thought my writing was wild and weird, he thought I wasn’t being wild enough.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Literary Hub has a great short <a href="https://lithub.com/ian-mcewan-on-bach-philip-roth-and-living-an-episodic-life/">interview</a> with Ian McEwan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What’s the best writing advice you’ve ever received?</strong>
When I was living in London at the start of my career in the mid-1970s,
I became friends with Philip Roth, who took an avuncular interest in my work.
Where many others thought my writing was wild and weird, he thought I wasn’t
being wild enough. He once came to my apartment and spread the typescript of
my first novel (The Cement Garden) over the floor. He was on his hands and
knees, moving the chapters around. What he wanted was for me to be bolder,
crazier. He said, “You have to write as though your parents are dead.” My
parents were alive. I took that advice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great advice. How often do we restrain from writing, posting, or expressing our
thoughts because of our shyness? Or fear of being judged? Besides, I would take
any advice from someone who has this to say about Bach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Which non-literary piece of culture—film, TV show, painting, song—could you
not imagine your life without?</strong> Since the age of 16, my constant resource has
been the music of Bach. Piano first, then all the rest. Like all music, it is
as abstract as literature is specific, but Bach’s inventions are more so—like
the processes of thought before language, deeply human without saying
anything at all. In his music I think I confront the most naked demonstration
of genius. Wrapped inside the beauty is a form of merriness and a joyful
pulse. The same pieces that thrilled me in my teens—the Goldberg Variations,
the Well-tempered Clavier—thrill me now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I loved how he saved the day by brilliantly answering the most boring writer
question of all times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What time of day do you write?</strong> The morning. My philosopher friend Galen
Strawson divides humanity into those who feel they are living in a constantly
unfolding narrative, a life story that informs our every moment, and those
who existence is discontinuous. I now understand that I belong in this latter
group, even while I’ve often persuaded myself I was in the first. [&hellip;] Now
I can relax. I belong with those whose lives are lived in discrete patches.
We can, of course, remember our childhoods, our first loves, our failures and
joys when asked to, but almost all of our daily experience is disconnected
from any awareness of the past. We also acknowledge that most of that past is
lost to us forever. We, the non-narrativists, or episodists, wake in the
mornings and we begin anew. I am my own blank sheet. As the day wears on,
familiar concerns—domestic, professional, political, crowd in. The thing
about that waiting desk is that you must turn up—and get there before the
blank sheet that is you turns dog-eared.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon <a href="http://blog.crunchydata.com/blog/cleaning-up-your-postgres-database">Cleaning Up Your Postgres Databases</a>. It offers useful
advice on spotting performance bottlenecks in your Postgres database. Take the
cache and index hit queries, for example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first thing you&rsquo;re going to want to look at is your cache hit ratio and
index hit ratio. Your cache hit ratio is going to give the percentage of time
your data is served from within memory vs. having to go to disk. Generally
serving data from memory vs. disk is going to orders of magnitude faster,
thus the more you can serve from memory the better. For a typical web
application making a lot of short requests I&rsquo;m going to target &gt; 99% here.</p>

      <description>The always brilliant Hynek recently posted Semantic Versioning Will Not Save You. Primarily targeted at consumers of SemVer-versioned packages, it is full of insightful advice.
From my perspective as an open-source maintainer, I can tell you that versioning is hard. Judging when a new release is going to break backward compatibility is not as simple as it might seem on the surface, and Hynek does a great job explaining why. Sometimes it is also hard for me to tell if a change in a codebase classifies as a new feature, small improvement, or fix—subtle differences.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The always brilliant Hynek recently posted <a href="https://hynek.me/articles/semver-will-not-save-you/">Semantic Versioning Will Not Save
You</a>. Primarily targeted at <em>consumers</em> of SemVer-versioned packages, it is
full of insightful advice.</p>
<p>From my perspective as an open-source maintainer, I can tell you that
versioning is hard. Judging when a new release is going to break backward
compatibility is not as simple as it might seem on the surface, and Hynek does
a great job explaining why. Sometimes it is also hard for me to tell if
a change in a codebase classifies as a new feature, small improvement, or
fix—subtle differences. In the context of SemVer, it matters a lot because
version numbers have a meaning. Consumers will likely decide whether to upgrade
or not based on that meaning.</p>
<p>Admittedly, and precisely because I did not feel comfortable giving guarantees,
the <a href="https://hynek.me/articles/semver-will-not-save-you/">Eve</a> project has been <a href="https://0ver.org/">0-versioned</a> for seven years. Seven years!
I wanted it to be mature, battle-tested and stable; only then would I feel
comfortable going 1.0. In Eve&rsquo;s case, 1.0 means not only &ldquo;stable&rdquo; but also
&ldquo;done.&rdquo; All major features are in, and they are stable. I am not alone, of
course. Flask, the web-framework on which Eve builds, has been 0-versioned for
many years too. I&rsquo;ve also been on the receiving hand of SemVer-related issues,
check the Eve backlog. The same happened with my other projects (<a href="https://python-cerberus.org">Cerberus</a>
is the exception as it has no dependencies.)</p>
<p>Hynek&rsquo;s point, I think, is that SemVer is a just convention. At each new
release, a semantic-versioned package expresses the maintainer&rsquo;s intention, but
there are no guarantees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This does not mean that SemVer is bad or worthless. Knowing the intentions of
a maintainer can be valuable – especially when things break. Because that’s
all SemVer is: a TL;DR of the changelog. What it does mean though, is that
you can’t rely on the semantic meaning of SemVer and <strong>you must treat every
update as potentially breaking</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure you read the Taking Responsibility section. It has sound advice on
protecting your project from dependency hell.</p>

another<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> New Yorker piece but this time signed by Anna Wiener. This article is
a long-read on Moxie Marlinspike, co-founder and CEO of Signal. Moxie is
a childhood nickname. That alone signals (pun intended) an original
personality. I mean, how many times have you heard of a CEO going by his
childhood nickname?</p>
<p>Indeed the personal story of Marlinspike, along with that of the ascent of
Signal, is fascinating. I did not know, for example, that in 2013 he met Brian
Acton, founder of WhatsApp. Brian expressed interest in adding end-to-end
encryption into WhatsApp. Then came Facebook&rsquo;s acquisition, and, for obvious
reasons, Signal Protocol never landed into the messaging service. The story was
not over, however:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That year, Acton left Facebook, later attributing his departure to
intractable differences about privacy practices. At the heart of the conflict
was tension with Facebook’s top executives, Sheryl Sandberg and Mark
Zuckerberg, who wanted to extend Facebook’s targeted-ad network to WhatsApp.
End-to-end encryption precluded the collection of message content that would
be valuable to advertisers. In early 2018, Acton and Marlinspike announced
the formation of the Signal Foundation, a nonprofit. Acton, the foundation’s
chairman and sole member, seeded it with a no-interest, fifty-million-dollar
loan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a plot twist. What&rsquo;s even more remarkable is Moxie&rsquo;s personal biography.
He is not your average startup co-founder, not by any mean. He kind stands at
the interconnection between activism, ethical hacking, and anarchy, and yet
he&rsquo;s the CEO of a booming startup.</p>

<p>I am surprised that the author, who clearly researched the topic well, did not

on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/arts/music/five-minutes-love-music.html">Five Minutes To Make You Love Classical Music</a>. This remarkable project aims
at &ldquo;hooking readers on classical music, five minutes at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once a month online, about 15 musicians, pop-culture figures and Times
writers and editors each select the piece they would play for a friend tied
to a theme, be it an instrument, composer, genre or voice type. The series
aims to make classical music accessible to readers as a Top 40 track [&hellip;].
You don&rsquo;t need to know the difference between a cadenza and a concerto. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
about pure pleasure and exploration.&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/insider/five-minutes-love-classical-music.html">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this project interesting for many reasons, the main one being the
variance of choices and themes. Picks are often excellent and not obvious. This
is, I think, because of the wide range of people involved with the selections.
You may have Yo-Yo Ma suggest a Concerto for the Cello installment, and then
Mark Hamill or Condoleeza Rice propose a listening for the Mozart segment. How
about Cecilia Bartoli for Baroque music?</p>
<p>Mind you, I am not a classical music expert. I just try and like to listen to
good music, regardless of the genre. I am probably the ideal target for
a project like this, which explains why I keep coming back. My favorite?
Probably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/arts/music/five-minutes-classical-music-cello.html">Five Minutes That Will Make You Love the Cello</a>, although I am
having a hard time accepting that Bach&rsquo;s Suite No. 1 is not included in the
selection (Suite No. 5 is, though.)</p>
<p>Official NYT playlists for the series are available on Spotify and, I presume,
other platforms. I know because I wasted a couple hours building my own before
finding out.</p>

      <description>In March 1970, Dr. John Conway sent the &amp;ldquo;fatal&amp;rdquo; (as he later referred to it) letter to Martin Gardner. He was submitting ideas for Gardner&amp;rsquo;s Mathematical Games column in Scientific American.
The New York Times features a good article on the fifty-year parable of The Game of Life.

letter to Martin Gardner. He was submitting ideas for Gardner&rsquo;s Mathematical
Games column in Scientific American.</p>
<p>The New York Times features a good article on the fifty-year parable of The
Game of Life. What&rsquo;s appreciable, they asked some of Life&rsquo;s most steadfast
friends to reflect upon its influence and lessons over half a century. Among
them, Brian Eno, who, being Brian Eno, has some smart things to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The Game of] Life shows you two things. The first is sensitivity to initial
conditions. A tiny change in the rules can produce a huge difference in the
output, ranging from complete destruction (no dots) through stasis (a frozen
pattern) to patterns that keep changing as they unfold.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second thing Life shows us is something that Darwin hit upon when he was
looking at Life, the organic version. Complexity arises from simplicity! That
is such a revelation; we are used to the idea that anything complex must
arise out of something more complex. Human brains design airplanes, not the
other way around. Life shows us complex virtual &ldquo;organisms&rdquo; arising out of
the interaction of a few simple rules — so goodbye &ldquo;Intelligent Design.&rdquo;</p>

      <description>Ever had your old, trusty Python virtual environment fail on you? I sure did. Sometimes, when I activate or switch between virtual environments, I get the following error:
$ workon eve dyld: Library not loaded: @executable_path/../.Python I never really took the time to look into it. When this happens, because I am in a rush (and because I am a lazy old fart), I shrug it off, recreate the virtual environment on the spot, and get back to work.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever had your old, trusty Python virtual environment fail on you? I sure did.
Sometimes, when I activate or switch between virtual environments, I get the
following error:</p>
<pre><code>$ workon eve
dyld: Library not loaded: @executable_path/../.Python
</code></pre>
<p>I never really took the time to look into it. When this happens, because I am
in a rush (and because I am a lazy old fart), I shrug it off, recreate the
virtual environment on the spot, and get back to work.</p>
<p>My friend Justin Mayer knows better. The other day, he posted a <a href="https://justinmayer.com/posts/homebrew-python-is-not-for-you/">short
insightful article</a> about this very same issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you heard stories about why you shouldn’t use the system-bundled
Python, so instead you use Homebrew to install Python and then use its
interpreter to create a virtual environment. A month later, you activate that
same environment, and when you try to use it, you see this inscrutable error:
(&hellip;) What happened? The Python interpreter referenced by the virtual
environment… no longer exists. But how can that be? You didn’t change
anything! You didn’t change anything… but Homebrew did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Homebrew is the culprit. If you have been affected (and if you have done any
length of serious Python work, you have), then go <a href="https://justinmayer.com/posts/homebrew-python-is-not-for-you/">read</a> Justin&rsquo;s piece. He
explains the whys and then goes into the hows you solve the problem for good.</p>

      <description>After six years in the field, Chris has shared his strong opinions on software development practices, languages, and methodologies. I like his attitude. Willingness to continuously put one&amp;rsquo;s personal views under scrutiny, eventually adapting or even changing them as needed, is not a common trait. Not in our field. While I generally agree with most of his opinions, I feel the urge to comment on a few of them.
Typed languages are better when you&amp;rsquo;re working on a team of people with various experience levels</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After six years in the field, Chris has <a href="https://chriskiehl.com/article/thoughts-after-6-years">shared</a> his strong opinions on
software development practices, languages, and methodologies. I like his
attitude. Willingness to continuously put one&rsquo;s personal views under scrutiny,
eventually adapting or even changing them as needed, is not a common trait. Not
in our field. While I generally agree with most of his opinions, I feel the
urge to comment on a few of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typed languages are better when you&rsquo;re working on a team of people with
various experience levels</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typed languages are better, period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software architecture probably matters more than anything else. A shitty
implementation of a good abstraction causes no net harm to the code base.
A bad abstraction or missing layer causes everything to rot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perfect. I am stealing this line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clever code isn&rsquo;t usually good code. Clarity trumps all other concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good <em>and</em> clever code is very possible, though. Agree on the second part.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bad code can be written in any paradigm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ça va sans dire</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So called &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; are contextual and not broadly applicable. Blindly
following them makes you an idiot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not following them also makes you an idiot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Designing scalable systems when you don&rsquo;t need to makes you a bad engineer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how do I know in advance whether I need to be scalable or not? Not always
an easy call. Also, scalability doesn&rsquo;t necessarily imply complexity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, RDBMS &gt; NoSql</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, use the right tool for the right job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Functional programming is another tool, not a panacea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The jury is out on this one. In my admittedly limited experience, functional
programming tends to win over OOP. It&rsquo;s not a coincidence that most OOP
languages keep adding functional features (looking at you, C#.).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pencil and paper are the best programming tools and vastly under used</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Old fart me concurs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trading purity in exchange for practicality is usually a good call</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get carried away with that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talking directly to the customer always reveals more about the problem, in
less time, and with higher accuracy</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>:s/always/sometimes</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word &ldquo;scalable&rdquo; has a mystical and stupefying power over the mind of the
software engineer. Its mere utterance can whip them into a depraved frenzy.
Grim actions have been justified using this word</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I plea guilty on this one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite being called &ldquo;engineers,&rdquo; most decision are pure cargo-cult with no
backing analysis, data, or numbers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a software craftsman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who stress over code style, linting rules, or other minutia are insane
weirdos</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am an insane weirdo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Code coverage has absolutely nothing to do with code quality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also has nothing to do with <em>tests</em> quality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monoliths are pretty good in most circumstances</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>:s/most/some</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TDD purists are just the worst. Their frail little minds can&rsquo;t process the
existence of different workflows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ouch. This hurts.</p>
<p>I am not sure I would have had so many well-formed opinions only six years in.

      <title>The Great Unbundling according to Benedict Evans</title>

      <description>As a non-native English reader, I had to look up the true meaning of &amp;ldquo;Unbundling&amp;rdquo; as a neologism. According to Wikipedia
Unbundling is a neologism to describe how the ubiquity of mobile devices, Internet connectivity, consumer web technologies, social media and information access in the 21st century is affecting older institutions (education, broadcasting, newspapers, games, shopping, etc.) by &amp;ldquo;break[ing] up the packages they once offered (possibly even for free), providing particular parts of them at a scale and cost unmatchable by the old order.</description>

</blockquote>
<p>Every year Benedict Evans, former Andreessen Howoritz partner and now
independent analyst, produces a big presentation digging into macro and
strategic trends in the tech industry. This year, <em>The Great Unbundling</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Covid brought shock and a lot of broken habits to tech, but mostly, it
accelerates everything that was already changing. 20 trillion dollars of
retail, brands, TV and advertising is being overturned, and software is
remaking everything from cars to pharma. Meanwhile, China has more smartphone
users than Europe and the USA combined, and India is close behind</p>
<ul>
<li>technology and innovation will be much more widely spread. For that and
lots of other reasons, tech is becoming a regulated industry, but if we step
over the slogans, what does that actually mean? Tech is entering its second
50 years.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this work to be worth studying. It draws a detailed, informed picture of
what happened in technology and the economy these last years. It also offers
insights, with some foresight, into what might come next.</p>

      <title>The unreasonable effectiveness of simple HTML</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve seen other articles pointing the finger at unnecessarily bloated websites. Terence Eden&amp;rsquo;s On the unreasonable effectiveness of simple HTML deserves mention, I think, for two reasons. First, the delivery is incredibly effective. Second, it is effective because of the storytelling.
By enveloping the message into an original short, touching story, he achieves two goals. First, he captures the reader&amp;rsquo;s attention; second, he makes the experience memorable. Please, go and read it; I&amp;rsquo;ll wait here.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;ve seen other articles pointing the finger at unnecessarily bloated
websites. Terence Eden&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/01/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-simple-html/">On the unreasonable effectiveness of simple
HTML</a></em> deserves mention, I think, for two reasons. First, the delivery is
incredibly effective. Second, it is effective because of the storytelling.</p>
<p>By enveloping the message into an original short, touching story, he achieves
two goals. First, he captures the reader&rsquo;s attention; second, he makes the
experience memorable. Please, go and read it; I&rsquo;ll wait here.</p>
<p>In the second paragraph, we&rsquo;re already knee-deep into the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the middle, a young woman sits on a hard plastic chair. She is surrounded
by canvas-bags containing her worldly possessions. She doesn’t look like she
is in a great emotional place right now. Clutched in her hands is a games
console – a PlayStation Portable. She stares at it intensely; blocking out
the world with Candy Crush. Or, at least, that’s what I thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, in the second to last paragraph, when the story is long over, notice the
expedient of echoing elements from the story (the woman&rsquo;s chair; the small
obsolete device; both uncomfortable) to reinforce the message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go sit in an uncomfortable chair, in an uncomfortable location, and stare at
an uncomfortably small screen with an uncomfortably outdated web browser. How
easy is it to use the websites you’ve created?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For added momentum, the last paragraph reconciliates the story and the
message—worth a read. Style notes aside, of course, unless your website serves
static content, some Javascript is probably going to be unavoidable. The point
still stands, though: do not overdo it. Or, as Confucius would say, do not use
a cannon to kill a mosquito.</p>

      <description>Bless the Internet Archive and its Wayback Machine. With it, we can go back in time and read The short, tormented life of computer genius Phil Katz, an unusually detailed and accurate article published in the April 14, 2000 issue of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bless the Internet Archive and its Wayback Machine. With it, we can go back in
time and read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000829071343/http://www2.jsonline.com/news/state/may00/katz21052000a.asp">The short, tormented life of computer genius Phil
Katz</a>, an unusually detailed and accurate article published in the April 14,
2000 issue of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When he was found dead April 14, Phil Katz was slumped against a nightstand
in a south side hotel, cradling an empty bottle of peppermint schnapps. The
genius who built a multimillion-dollar software company known worldwide for
its pioneering &ldquo;zip&rdquo; files had died of acute pancreatic bleeding caused by
chronic alcoholism. He was alone, estranged long ago from his family and
a virtual stranger to employees of his own company, PKWare Inc. He was 37.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the late 80s, when the culmination of Katz&rsquo;s work on compression algorithms,
PKZIP, emerged as the clear winner of the so-called &ldquo;compressors war,&rdquo; <a href="http://nicolaiarocci.com/a-trip-down-memory-lane-fidonet-and-usenet/">I was
running my own little BBS</a>, Lorien, which later evolved into Phoenix BBS,
a fully-fledged FidoNet node. When Lorien went first online in 1987, most if
not all downloadables were in ARC format. Three years later, in 1990, when
Phoenix emerged from Lorien&rsquo;s ashes, ZIP archives ruled the world. Fast forward
30 years. A couple of days ago, I wrote C# code that receives data streams over
a REST API and then stores them as ZIP files.</p>
<p>I would be hard-pressed to find another piece of shareware, single-handly
developed software that has been as influential, pervasive, and widespread in
the industry as PKZIP from PKWare. Of course, Linux and SQLite, although both
came later (the former in 1991, the latter in the spring of 2000.)</p>
<p>Katz&rsquo;s story is indeed a cautionary tale of genius, torment, and horrible
demise. I cannot help but wonder: would his life trajectory have been different
had he not been so successful? Probably not, given the details revealed in
the article, but who knows. For sure, the tormented story of Phil Katz leaves
me with one clear takeaway. Success does not grant happiness.</p>
