      <title>A motorcycle trip across Europe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, I returned from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tomcc.org/Trifest/tomcc75&#34;&gt;Trifest 75&lt;/a&gt;,
a motorcycle rally organized by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tomcc.org&#34;&gt;Triumph Owners Motorcycle
Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; at the Shelsley Walsh Hill Climb, Worcester, UK.
Crossing Europe from South to North took us a whole week across Italy,
Switzerland, and France before reaching the soil of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outing was conceived long ago (Trifest happen every year) and has always
been postponed because of the high cost and time required. This year, we took
the opportunity of the 75th anniversary to go, partly because I sensed the great
interest while talking about the idea at various rallies we had last year in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

a motorcycle rally organized by the <a href="https://tomcc.org">Triumph Owners Motorcycle

Crossing Europe from South to North took us a whole week across Italy,
Switzerland, and France before reaching the soil of England.</p>
<p>This outing was conceived long ago (Trifest happen every year) and has always
been postponed because of the high cost and time required. This year, we took
the opportunity of the 75th anniversary to go, partly because I sensed the great
interest while talking about the idea at various rallies we had last year in Italy.</p>
<p>We were twenty motorcycles strong. Leading such a large group across Europe for
4,000 km is no joke, but somehow, we made it through without significant issues.
Energy and mood were always high, and we were welcomed with open arms by our
English friends and by the other Triumph Owners Clubs attending: Germany,
Sweden, and Holland. It was an excellent opportunity to strengthen the bond
between us Italians and make new international friendships, laying the
foundation, who knows, for future occasions.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I attended &lt;em&gt;Eroica 2023&lt;/em&gt;, a motorcycling event organized by the Italian branch of the &lt;a href=&#34;https:/tomccitalia.org&#34;&gt;Triumph Owners
Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt; I currently preside. We rode the &lt;a href=&#34;https://eroica.cc/en&#34;&gt;Eroica&lt;/a&gt; route, a legendary gravel bicycle race that runs
through the most beautiful territories of the Tuscan Chianti region. It was glorious. The weather was perfect, the food
was incredible, and the close-knit party of thirty T.O.M.C.C. bikers had great fun. We all ended up covered in an
astonishing amount of powder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Motorcycling the Foreste Casentinesi National Park</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/motorcycling-the-foreste-casentinesi-national-park/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:05:25 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/motorcycling-the-foreste-casentinesi-national-park/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I went on a motorcycle trip with &lt;a href=&#34;https://tomccitalia.org&#34;&gt;my club&lt;/a&gt;. We had about forty
motorcycles, many coming from afarâ€”a tremendous turnout considering how
advanced the season is. This event was particularly involving for me, as my
local group was in charge of the organization. We were going to visit the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parco_nazionale_delle_Foreste_Casentinesi%2C_Monte_Falterona_e_Campigna&#34;&gt;Foreste Casentinesi National Park&lt;/a&gt;, which isn&amp;rsquo;t far from our hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know those roads and their surroundings well; we call them home, yet
I insisted on scouting the planned route not once but twice, and I think it was
crucial to the event&amp;rsquo;s success. On the narrow road that climbs to a mountain
pass, we spotted a mobile traffic light (for a road construction site) with
a long (six minutes!) red/green cycle. We arranged a plan in case the
motorcycle&amp;rsquo;s column split at the light: almost one kilometer past the red
light, there was a safe place where the forward group could safely stop off the
road and wait for the rest to rejoin. All the participants were informed at the
departure briefing: if you get stopped at the red light, don&amp;rsquo;t get
over-stressed: we&amp;rsquo;ll be waiting for you one kilometer down the road. You won&amp;rsquo;t
see us, but we&amp;rsquo;ll be waiting for you safely. Don&amp;rsquo;t rush it, and don&amp;rsquo;t stop to
phone us. We won&amp;rsquo;t be at the first apparently-good parking place but at the
second spot, which, despite not looking as good, is way safer (less gravel on
the ground). Situations like these can cause confusion and danger to a large
group of motorcycles roaming on narrow, steep mountain roads which are often in
poor conditiong. The reconnaissance ride allowed us to plan for several
potential pitfalls like this one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;m rambling. It was a great late autumn trip. The woods are
spectacular this time of the year, which is why we hit that area with this
trip.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I went on a motorcycle trip with &lt;a href=&#34;https://tomccitalia.org&#34;&gt;my club&lt;/a&gt;. Our goal was to
visit the beautiful Dolomites in the Italian Alps&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We had twenty
motorcycles on the road, evenly split between modern classics (Bonnevillles in
all their variations) and adventure bikes (Tigers new and old). A great turnout
considering that the weather forecast for the weekend wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly great. Of
all the TOMCC members who registered, only two were missing because they tested
positive for COVID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Last weekend I went on a motorcycle trip with <a href="https://tomccitalia.org">my club</a>. Our goal was to
visit the beautiful Dolomites in the Italian Alps<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. We had twenty
motorcycles on the road, evenly split between modern classics (Bonnevillles in
all their variations) and adventure bikes (Tigers new and old). A great turnout
considering that the weather forecast for the weekend wasn&rsquo;t exactly great. Of
all the TOMCC members who registered, only two were missing because they tested
positive for COVID.</p>
<p>Seeing old and new friends and spending time together roaming the mountain
roads felt great. We even visited places I didn&rsquo;t know about, namely the <a href="https://www.agordinodolomiti.it/index.php/cosa-vedere/natura/lago-del-mis/">Soffia
Falls at Mis Lake</a> and <a href="https://www.castellodiandraz.it">Castle Andraz</a>. After lunch at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Misurina">Malga
Misurina</a>, where the food was good and personnel not so much, we were
supposed to cover another long stretch of road up to the springs of the Piave
river. When we looked in that direction and saw the intimidating front of
blue/black clouds ready to open their floodgates on us, we changed our minds
and headed back to our base camp. We still got flooded, but certainly not as
much as if we&rsquo;d pressed on with the original plan. The next day, a handful of
us continued roaming the countryside for more fantastic views, corners, food,
and camaraderie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful to Sandro (&ldquo;Momo&rdquo;) for organizing this event. I know very well how
demanding and stressful running a motorcycle event can be. So far, we&rsquo;ve always
been lucky to have people willing to take on the challenge and volunteer to
hold events all around the country. As long as this continues, we&rsquo;ll have
a bright future and lots of fun.</p>

      <title>Triumph Bonneville Dolomites Ride 2021</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So the motorcycle-touring season has started, albeit a little late this year
because of the COVID situation, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been avidly pursuing it. On Sunday,
I embarked on a 700 km trip from my place to the Dolomites and back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a glorious day.  We (&lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/musings-on-an-unexpected-motorcycle-trip/&#34;&gt;Antonio&lt;/a&gt; and I) visited many renowned
Mountain Passes, enjoyed stunning views, ate great food and chatted like
there&amp;rsquo;s no tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my GoPro along with me. I wanted to record some scenes to inspire my
motorcycle club&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; comrades. However, I admit I was dubious that it would be
worth the hassle. Filming while driving would be difficult; editing and
assembling the cuts later would be tedious. Moreover, I have almost no
experience with this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the motorcycle-touring season has started, albeit a little late this year
because of the COVID situation, and I&rsquo;ve been avidly pursuing it. On Sunday,
I embarked on a 700 km trip from my place to the Dolomites and back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a glorious day.  We (<a href="/musings-on-an-unexpected-motorcycle-trip/">Antonio</a> and I) visited many renowned
Mountain Passes, enjoyed stunning views, ate great food and chatted like
there&rsquo;s no tomorrow.</p>
<p>I took my GoPro along with me. I wanted to record some scenes to inspire my
motorcycle club<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> comrades. However, I admit I was dubious that it would be
worth the hassle. Filming while driving would be difficult; editing and
assembling the cuts later would be tedious. Moreover, I have almost no
experience with this stuff.</p>
<p>The video is available on YouTube, and I already know it&rsquo;s probably too long.
Ideally, it should feature live voice recording, possibly a second camera
point-of-view, and, heck, even some drone footage<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. But it&rsquo;s only the first
attempt; it will have to do.</p>
<p>Contrary to my expectations, filming on the go wasn&rsquo;t too stressful, and
editing was.. ok I guess. However, once it was done and I finally got to watch
it, I realized the obvious: it will primarily serve as a remarkable memory of
a glorious day. Eventually, it will also inspire some of my club comrades; but
that&rsquo;s now a secondary goal.</p>
