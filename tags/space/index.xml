      <description>A fascinating article surfaced on Nautilus last week. Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of religion and science in society at Wesleyan University, shares her concerns about the technical strides and aspirations of Elon Musk&amp;rsquo;s SpaceX, the company&amp;rsquo;s mission to enable thousands of people to live on Mars, and the ethics of terraforming the planet to be more like Earth. What&amp;rsquo;s intriguing, though, is Rubenstein&amp;rsquo;s thoughts about the religious underpinnings of the United States space program and how even modern science is still hostage to imperialistic Christian ideas.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fascinating article surfaced on Nautilus last week. Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of religion and science in
society at Wesleyan University, shares her concerns about the technical strides and aspirations of Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX,
the company&rsquo;s mission to enable thousands of people to live on Mars, and the ethics of terraforming the planet to be
more like Earth. What&rsquo;s intriguing, though, is Rubenstein&rsquo;s thoughts about the religious underpinnings of the United
States space program and how even modern science is still hostage to imperialistic Christian ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I started realizing that religion shows up in the natural sciences and the contemporary world in a funny and alarming
way,” Rubenstein said. “Because sciences tend to think of themselves as something as far away as possible from
religion, as having freed themselves from God. To an extent that’s true. But in the process, they tend to generate
these big stories, big mythologies, about the origins and the ends of the world. And conjure characters who are
heroes, gods, and monsters. I started tracking the way that the natural sciences themselves generate new ways of
understanding the world that, a couple centuries ago, we would have called religion.”</p>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s now old news that the James Webb Telescope was successfully launched on Christmas Day. But last Saturday marked another historic moment for this incredible human artifact:
After a quarter-century of effort by tens of thousands of people, more than $10 billion in taxpayer funding, and some 350 deployment mechanisms that had to go just so, the James Webb Space Telescope fully unfurled its wings. The massive spacecraft completed its final deployments, and, by God, the process went smoothly.</description>

<p>Ars Technica&rsquo;s Eric Berger has long been my go-to pusher for space-related
stuff. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/remarkably-nasa-has-completed-deployment-of-the-webb-space-telescope/">His report</a> on Saturday&rsquo;s milestone is accurate and to the point as
usual. Today he has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/all-hail-the-ariane-5-rocket-which-doubled-the-webb-telescopes-lifetime/">another article</a> on ESA Arianne 5&rsquo;s fundamental
contribution to the mission. I love how modern, successful space missions are
almost always the result of no-bullshit joint efforts by multiple international
actors.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> The James Webb Telescope <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/24/1075437484/james-webb-telescope-final-destination">has reached its final destination</a>.</p>

      <title>On the incredible opportunities offered by Starship</title>

      <description>Space-junkie me is back, this time reading about the innumerable opportunities that SpaceX&amp;rsquo;s Starship will offer once it becomes operational, hopefully no later than this year or the next. In his Science Upside for Starship, the exceptionally knowledgeable Casey Handmer makes a case for Starship relevance in the future of space exploration by listing an astounding number of reasonable use-cases for the vessel.
I think it is relatively straightforward to think of cool things to do with SpaceX Starships, so recent posts have focused on trying to understand the more mixed consequences for incumbent industrial organizations that are not ideally positioned to exploit the coming advances.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it is relatively straightforward to think of cool things to do with
SpaceX Starships, so recent posts have focused on trying to understand the
more mixed consequences for incumbent industrial organizations that are not
ideally positioned to exploit the coming advances. It is, however, a fun
exercise to enumerate all the ways in which Starship and related technologies
can help execute bold, ambitious missions of scientific discovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s long-form, yes, but well worth it. Oh, and while you&rsquo;re at it, you might
as well read <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/10/28/starship-is-still-not-understood/">Starship is Still Not Understood</a>, Casey&rsquo;s previous article on the
topic.</p>

      <description>Only 24 people have journeyed far enough to see the whole Earth against the black of space. The images they brought back changed our world. Here is a selection of the most beautiful photographs of Earth — iconic images and unknown gems — digitally restored to their full glory.
Toby Ord&amp;rsquo;s recent Earth Restored project is a must-see.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a space junkie. So tonight, like all the other space junkies on the planet, I watched in awe as Perseverance seamlessly and beautifully landed on the surface of Mars. This is a phenomenal achievement. Of course, I will eagerly follow her1 progress.
As I was following the live broadcast, I wondered: What kind of hardware and software runs all this incredible technology? It was launched in 2020, so it must be some cutting-edge stuff.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a space junkie. So tonight, like all the other space junkies on the planet,
I watched in awe as Perseverance seamlessly and beautifully landed on the
surface of Mars. This is a phenomenal achievement. Of course, I will eagerly
follow her<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> progress.</p>
<p>As I was following the live broadcast, I wondered: What kind of hardware and
software runs all this incredible technology? It was launched in 2020, so it
must be some cutting-edge stuff. As it turns out, that isn&rsquo;t really the case.</p>
<p>Perseverance computer uses the BAE RAD750 radiation-hardened single board
computer<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Released twenty years ago (2001), the RAD750 is based on the
PowerPC 750, designed by IBM and Motorola and released in 1997<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. The exact
same computer is mounted on Curiosity<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, which launched ten years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It basically has the power of a circa 1992 Pentium 1 chip and will be
responsible for handling the entire avionics architecture of the rover
designed and programmed by NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) ([source][6])</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the same source, we learn that at least good-ole RAD750 is not left alone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &lsquo;old school&rsquo; RDA750 computer will work in tandem with a series of
field-programmable gate array (FPGA) computers to control such things as the
drivetrain, wheels, suspension and cameras.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could not find any reliable information on the programming languages
involved. I am guessing a mix of C/C++ and maybe Ada, as is typical of the
aerospace industry. The operating system itself is VxWorks<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, a real-time
operating system initially released in 1987. This is a fascinating piece of
software.</p>
<p>Two considerations come to mind. First, and I am repeating myself here, what
a phenomenal achievement this landing is. As we watched the broadcast, I told
my wife: these guys are literally making the future of humanity. What did
I know that they&rsquo;re making it on twenty-year-old technology. Second. We,
ordinary people, might all be using way more power (and grid) than is really
needed.</p>
<p><em>Updated on February 23th, 2021:</em></p>
<p>On Monday, NASA released [a video][7] of Perseverance&rsquo;s descent to the red
planet. If it looks like aliens are descending on the surface, it&rsquo;s because,
well, that is what happens. We are the aliens. NASA also released an absolutely
mind-blowing [recording][8] of sounds from Mars&rsquo;s surface.</p>
