      <description>The name SQLite is a nice name, but the &amp;ldquo;lite&amp;rdquo; part is misleading, it sounds like it is only useful for tiny things - which is very wrong. SQLite should be named AwesomeSQL, because that is what it is. SQLite is probably the only database you will ever need in most cases

Which, in the real world, happens way more frequently than we all imagine.</p>
