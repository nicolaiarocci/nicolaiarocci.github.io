      <description>When I read Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds &amp;amp; Shape Our Futures by Merlin Sheldrake1, I was stunned by the scale and importance of the mycorrhizal network that lies beneath the surface of any given forest in the world. The &amp;ldquo;wood wide web&amp;rdquo;, as scientists started to call it, sounded like the perfect metaphor for such an incredibly efficient, symbiotic relation between fungi and trees.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I read <em>Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds
&amp; Shape Our Futures</em> by Merlin Sheldrake<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I was stunned by the scale and
importance of the mycorrhizal network that lies beneath the surface of any
given forest in the world. The &ldquo;wood wide web&rdquo;, as scientists started to call
it, sounded like the perfect metaphor for such an incredibly efficient,
symbiotic relation between fungi and trees.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://newpublic.org/article/1572/the-word-for-web-is-fores://newpublic.org/article/1572/the-word-for-web-is-forest">The Word for Web is Forest</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, Claire L. Evans brilliantly reverses the
perspective. If the wood wide web metaphor holds, we can see the world wide web
as a live, intermingled network of interconnected, initially decentralized and
perhaps symbiotic entities. The issues we face in the modern web are not
dissimilar from those faced by ill forests worldwide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wood wide web has been a powerhouse metaphor for popularizing the
mutualistic relationships of healthy forests. But like a struggling forest,
the web is no longer healthy. It has been wounded and depleted in the pursuit
of profit. Going online today is not an invigorating walk through a green
woodland—it’s rush-hour traffic alongside a freeway median of diseased trees,
littered with the detritus of late capitalism. If we want to repair this
damage, we must look to the wisdom of the forest and listen to ecologists
like Simard when they tell us just how sustainable, interdependent,
life-giving systems work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suzane Simard, the Canadian ecologist who revealed the cooperative nature of
forests, explains that Mother Trees (the eldest trees) serve as &ldquo;central hubs
of the wood wide web.  They are the strongest, the most resource-rich, with
taproots stretching far beneath the earth.&rdquo; When a Mother Tree dies, it shares
its resources with the forest while many other Mothers guarantee the
continuity and integrity of the ecosystem. This used to be the case with the
Web too, but not anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The web isn’t what it used to be. When the editors of Nature compared
mycorrhizal fungi to a computer network, the web was still predominantly
peer-to-peer, its users sharing their thoughts on personal home pages and
homespun message-boards. Online advertising was in its infancy. But as the
web has centralized, it has strayed further and further from the ideal
presented by the wood wide web [..] By selecting for the most inflammatory
and emotional content, Big Tech has algorithmically weeded the forest into
a field of commercial timber.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evans then proceeds to suggest that we should probably strive to imitate
mycorrhizal networks and (re?)build decentralized networks, with &ldquo;Mother nodes
&ndash; sites in the network bearing a responsibility of care.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll stop here. Read
the <a href="https://newpublic.org/article/1572/the-word-for-web-is-fores://newpublic.org/article/1572/the-word-for-web-is-forest">article</a> now, there is a lot to absorb. She doesn&rsquo;t go into the details
of her proposed solution, but offers us an original, courageous and pregnant
point of view to consider.</p>
