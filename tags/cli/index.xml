      <description>One of my pet peeves has always been the many different, sometimes very original ways in which CLI tools handle help requests. POSIX sets the canon: -h or --help is how we ask for help. But no, some tools1 want to be original at the worst moment: when their users are struggling, looking for guidance.
It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat consolatory to learn that I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in this fight. The other day I landed on Clayton Craft&amp;rsquo;s blog.</description>
