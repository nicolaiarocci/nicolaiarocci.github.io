      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last year, a mindset shift and approach appeared as a very simple idea: just do one thing, &lt;em&gt;that I want to do today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing can be small or big, easy or labored, fleeting or long. I carve out time to go play drums for two hours, go for a bouldering session, do a shorter 20 minute run, read a page of a book, eat something I’m really excited about, and more. Even on the most difficult day, I can adjust and find the smallest thing that I am excited about and do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
