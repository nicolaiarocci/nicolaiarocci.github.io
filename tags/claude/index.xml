      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since yesterday, Claude Code has been included in the Pro subscription we&amp;rsquo;re signed up for. I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to try it for a while, and now nothing was stopping me. Only yesterday (a curious coincidence), I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/ai-changes-everything/&#34;&gt;AI Changes Everything&lt;/a&gt; by Armin Ronacher, which gave me a glimpse of the potential and made my hands itch to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initialization of Claude on the repository surprised me; the analysis (reported in CLAUDE.md) is thorough and reveals a good understanding of the project, including both the code and the general functioning, strategies, techniques, technologies and libraries employed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since yesterday, Claude Code has been included in the Pro subscription we&rsquo;re signed up for. I&rsquo;d been wanting to try it for a while, and now nothing was stopping me. Only yesterday (a curious coincidence), I read <a href="/ai-changes-everything/">AI Changes Everything</a> by Armin Ronacher, which gave me a glimpse of the potential and made my hands itch to try it.</p>
<p>The initialization of Claude on the repository surprised me; the analysis (reported in CLAUDE.md) is thorough and reveals a good understanding of the project, including both the code and the general functioning, strategies, techniques, technologies and libraries employed.</p>
<p>I asked Claude to generate a test suite from scratch, and it did so rather effortlessly (it went back and forth a few times, and it is fascinating following its reasoning and attempts from a distance). Claude added the tests to the existing project, a big no-no for me. I asked it to go back and create a dedicated test project, and it complied, adding the new project to the solution. It took several iterations to achieve a good result. We now have 134 tests that cover 98% of the project&rsquo;s business logic. Upon request, Claude also added code coverage by installing the missing tools.</p>
<p>Once satisfied with the test suite and having committed and pushed (via Claude) the work done, I asked Claude to set up a GitHub Action to run the tests on every push, then to update the existing workflows (container build; deployment to test or production; etc.) so they all run tests first.</p>
<p>In half a day of work, during which I mostly did other things, such as helping a colleague while Claude was chugging away, I achieved what would have taken me a week or even just a few days.</p>
<p>I have very little to complain about in terms of code quality, and where I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied, I informed Claude and the unsatisfying code was quickly and pleasantly refactored. However, some refactoring is better done with Rider because it&rsquo;s faster, doesn&rsquo;t miss anything (like Claude tends to do if there are multiple similar refactorings to be done and they are scattered across various files) and doesn&rsquo;t waste tokens that count toward usage limits (with the Pro subscription, we have access to a lighter tier of Claude Code. You want the Max subscription for unlimited - or higher anyway- ceiling).</p>
<p>One valuable feature is memory. You can have Claude memorize directives. This memory can be local to the repo or global. I instructed Claude to prefer collection expressions and utilize C#&rsquo;s new targeted-type initialization feature, among other things, which were duly noted. I then asked Claude to refactor in light of the new directives, and it did. New code is now produced according to my preferences, and it will be on all my projects.</p>
<p>A thorough code review is always necessary, of course, but wouldn&rsquo;t you do that for any code coming into your project?</p>
<p>Color me impressed so far. Copying and pasting from LLM&rsquo;s web UIs is already a thing of the past. The present is all about agents, and they&rsquo;re just getting started.</p>

      <title>Why do earthworms appear on wet roads?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s raining a lot these days, and during my early morning walk, I see many earthworms popping out of the ground and filling the sidewalks and the streets. I observed this behaviour many times in similarly wet conditions. So I asked Claude: &lt;em&gt;Why do earthworms appear on wet roads?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it rains heavily, streets fill with earthworms for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthworms breathe through their skin, which must remain moist. During heavy rainfall, their underground tunnels flood, forcing them to surface to avoid drowning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s raining a lot these days, and during my early morning walk, I see many earthworms popping out of the ground and filling the sidewalks and the streets. I observed this behaviour many times in similarly wet conditions. So I asked Claude: <em>Why do earthworms appear on wet roads?</em></p>
<p>When it rains heavily, streets fill with earthworms for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Earthworms breathe through their skin, which must remain moist. During heavy rainfall, their underground tunnels flood, forcing them to surface to avoid drowning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vibrations of raindrops on the soil can be mistaken by earthworms for those produced by predators like moles, causing them to flee to the surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rainy periods are ideal for earthworms to move and find new habitats or mates, as they can travel on the moist surface without risking dehydration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On paved surfaces like roads and sidewalks, water tends to accumulate more than in soil, creating conditions that attract earthworms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, once earthworms reach the asphalt, they often become trapped and unable to return to the soil, becoming easy prey or risking dehydration when the sun returns.</p>
