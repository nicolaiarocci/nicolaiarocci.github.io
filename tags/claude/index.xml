      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s raining a lot these days, and during my early morning walk, I see many earthworms popping out of the ground and filling the sidewalks and the streets. I observed this behaviour many times in similarly wet conditions. So I asked Claude: &lt;em&gt;Why do earthworms appear on wet roads?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it rains heavily, streets fill with earthworms for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthworms breathe through their skin, which must remain moist. During heavy rainfall, their underground tunnels flood, forcing them to surface to avoid drowning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I observed this behaviour many times in similarly wet conditions. So I asked Claude: <em>Why do earthworms appear on wet roads?</em></p>
<p>When it rains heavily, streets fill with earthworms for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Earthworms breathe through their skin, which must remain moist. During heavy rainfall, their underground tunnels flood, forcing them to surface to avoid drowning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vibrations of raindrops on the soil can be mistaken by earthworms for those produced by predators like moles, causing them to flee to the surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rainy periods are ideal for earthworms to move and find new habitats or mates, as they can travel on the moist surface without risking dehydration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On paved surfaces like roads and sidewalks, water tends to accumulate more than in soil, creating conditions that attract earthworms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, once earthworms reach the asphalt, they often become trapped and unable to return to the soil, becoming easy prey or risking dehydration when the sun returns.</p>
