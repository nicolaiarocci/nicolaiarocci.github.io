      <description>Chris Moran, the Guardian’s head of editorial innovation:
Last month one of our journalists received an interesting email. A researcher had come across mention of a Guardian article, written by the journalist on a specific subject from a few years before. But the piece was proving elusive on our website and in search. Had the headline perhaps been changed since it was launched? Had it been removed intentionally from the website because of a problem we’d identified?</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Last month one of our journalists received an interesting email. A researcher had come across mention of a Guardian
article, written by the journalist on a specific subject from a few years before. But the piece was proving elusive on
our website and in search. Had the headline perhaps been changed since it was launched? Had it been removed
intentionally from the website because of a problem we’d identified? Or had we been forced to take it down by the
subject of the piece through legal means?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reporter couldn’t remember writing the specific piece, but the headline certainly sounded like something they
would have written. It was a subject they were identified with and had a record of covering. Worried that there may
have been some mistake at our end, they asked colleagues to go back through our systems to track it down. Despite the
detailed records we keep of all our content, and especially around deletions or legal issues, they could find no trace
of its existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why? Because it had never been written.</p>
