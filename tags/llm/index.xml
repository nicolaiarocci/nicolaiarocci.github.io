      <title>Claude Code first impressions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since yesterday, Claude Code has been included in the Pro subscription we&amp;rsquo;re signed up for. I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to try it for a while, and now nothing was stopping me. Only yesterday (a curious coincidence), I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/ai-changes-everything/&#34;&gt;AI Changes Everything&lt;/a&gt; by Armin Ronacher, which gave me a glimpse of the potential and made my hands itch to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initialization of Claude on the repository surprised me; the analysis (reported in CLAUDE.md) is thorough and reveals a good understanding of the project, including both the code and the general functioning, strategies, techniques, technologies and libraries employed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since yesterday, Claude Code has been included in the Pro subscription we&rsquo;re signed up for. I&rsquo;d been wanting to try it for a while, and now nothing was stopping me. Only yesterday (a curious coincidence), I read <a href="/ai-changes-everything/">AI Changes Everything</a> by Armin Ronacher, which gave me a glimpse of the potential and made my hands itch to try it.</p>
<p>The initialization of Claude on the repository surprised me; the analysis (reported in CLAUDE.md) is thorough and reveals a good understanding of the project, including both the code and the general functioning, strategies, techniques, technologies and libraries employed.</p>
<p>I asked Claude to generate a test suite from scratch, and it did so rather effortlessly (it went back and forth a few times, and it is fascinating following its reasoning and attempts from a distance). Claude added the tests to the existing project, a big no-no for me. I asked it to go back and create a dedicated test project, and it complied, adding the new project to the solution. It took several iterations to achieve a good result. We now have 134 tests that cover 98% of the project&rsquo;s business logic. Upon request, Claude also added code coverage by installing the missing tools.</p>
<p>Once satisfied with the test suite and having committed and pushed (via Claude) the work done, I asked Claude to set up a GitHub Action to run the tests on every push, then to update the existing workflows (container build; deployment to test or production; etc.) so they all run tests first.</p>
<p>In half a day of work, during which I mostly did other things, such as helping a colleague while Claude was chugging away, I achieved what would have taken me a week or even just a few days.</p>
<p>I have very little to complain about in terms of code quality, and where I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied, I informed Claude and the unsatisfying code was quickly and pleasantly refactored. However, some refactoring is better done with Rider because it&rsquo;s faster, doesn&rsquo;t miss anything (like Claude tends to do if there are multiple similar refactorings to be done and they are scattered across various files) and doesn&rsquo;t waste tokens that count toward usage limits (with the Pro subscription, we have access to a lighter tier of Claude Code. You want the Max subscription for unlimited - or higher anyway- ceiling).</p>
<p>One valuable feature is memory. You can have Claude memorize directives. This memory can be local to the repo or global. I instructed Claude to prefer collection expressions and utilize C#&rsquo;s new targeted-type initialization feature, among other things, which were duly noted. I then asked Claude to refactor in light of the new directives, and it did. New code is now produced according to my preferences, and it will be on all my projects.</p>
<p>A thorough code review is always necessary, of course, but wouldn&rsquo;t you do that for any code coming into your project? Color me impressed so far.</p>

      <title>Why do earthworms appear on wet roads?</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/why-do-earthworms-appear-on-wet-roads/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s raining a lot these days, and during my early morning walk, I see many earthworms popping out of the ground and filling the sidewalks and the streets. I observed this behaviour many times in similarly wet conditions. So I asked Claude: &lt;em&gt;Why do earthworms appear on wet roads?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it rains heavily, streets fill with earthworms for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthworms breathe through their skin, which must remain moist. During heavy rainfall, their underground tunnels flood, forcing them to surface to avoid drowning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s raining a lot these days, and during my early morning walk, I see many earthworms popping out of the ground and filling the sidewalks and the streets. I observed this behaviour many times in similarly wet conditions. So I asked Claude: <em>Why do earthworms appear on wet roads?</em></p>
<p>When it rains heavily, streets fill with earthworms for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Earthworms breathe through their skin, which must remain moist. During heavy rainfall, their underground tunnels flood, forcing them to surface to avoid drowning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vibrations of raindrops on the soil can be mistaken by earthworms for those produced by predators like moles, causing them to flee to the surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rainy periods are ideal for earthworms to move and find new habitats or mates, as they can travel on the moist surface without risking dehydration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On paved surfaces like roads and sidewalks, water tends to accumulate more than in soil, creating conditions that attract earthworms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, once earthworms reach the asphalt, they often become trapped and unable to return to the soil, becoming easy prey or risking dehydration when the sun returns.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading Paul Auster&amp;rsquo;s The New York Trilogy&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. On this occasion, I discovered a new use for ChatGPT and LLMs. ChatGPT and I chatted about the themes, especially the correlations and connections between the three short novels that comprise the volume. It was an alienating and revealing experience. For the first time, I am reasoning about a book with a machine, not a person. Because it knows everything about the text and draws on the shared global knowledge, it can give more satisfaction than most people do (also, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to find someone around with whom I can talk about all the books I read!) Yes, it is wordy and repetitive, but it can stimulate and enrich my analysis&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using LLMs (ChatGPT and Claude) more and more lately, especially for work. The more I use them, the more I understand how to leverage their capabilities. I would have never thought about sharing my reading experiences with ChatGPT before. <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/getting-started-with-ai-good-enough">Ethan Mollick</a> has it right; we should all put at least 10 hours into LLMs before judging them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your goal is simple: spend 10 hours using AI on tasks that actually matter to you. After that, you&rsquo;ll have a natural sense of how AI fits into your work and life. You&rsquo;ll develop an intuition for effective prompting, and you&rsquo;ll better understand AI&rsquo;s potential. Don&rsquo;t aim for perfection - just start somewhere and learn as you go.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Hiring engineers is about composing teams. The smallest unit of software ownership is not the individual, it’s the team.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever been on a team packed exclusively with staff or principal engineers? It is not fun. That is not a high-functioning team. There is only so much high-level architecture and planning work to go around, there are only so many big decisions that need to be made. These engineers spend most of their time doing work that feels boring and repetitive, so they tend to over-engineer solutions and/or cut corners—sometimes at the same time. They compete for the “fun” stuff and find reasons to pick technical fights with each other. They chronically under-document and under-invest in the work that makes systems simple and tractable.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The best teams are ones where no one is bored, because every single person is working on something that challenges them and pushes their boundaries. The only way you can get this is by having a range of skill levels on the team.</p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Simon Willison has a new article explaining an important and often ununderstood
aspect of LLMs. There&amp;rsquo;s a remarkable difference between chatting with an LLM, as
we users do, and training it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short version: ChatGPT and other similar tools do not directly learn from and
memorize everything that you say to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you start a new chat conversation, you clear the slate. Each
conversation is an entirely new sequence, carried out entirely independently of
previous conversations from both yourself and other users. Understanding this is
key to working effectively with these models. Every time you hit “new chat” you
are effectively wiping the short-term memory of the model, starting again from
scratch. This has a number of important consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Open AI just did</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/what-open-ai-just-did/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 08:41:04 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/what-open-ai-just-did/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open AI just released ChatGPT 4o. The launch demo is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, and yes, it is impressive. They did not launch v5, though, and 4o is only incremental, not exponential, as v4 has been compared to its predecessor. It may mean we&amp;rsquo;re at the end of the &amp;ldquo;exponential growth&amp;rdquo; phase of LLM models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the most critical aspect of this release is not technical, as Ethan Mollick correctly pinpoints in his timely &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/what-openai-did&#34;&gt;What Open AI Did&lt;/a&gt; post:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Open AI just released ChatGPT 4o. The launch demo is available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw">YouTube</a>, and yes, it is impressive. They did not launch v5, though, and 4o is only incremental, not exponential, as v4 has been compared to its predecessor. It may mean we&rsquo;re at the end of the &ldquo;exponential growth&rdquo; phase of LLM models.</p>
<p>However, the most critical aspect of this release is not technical, as Ethan Mollick correctly pinpoints in his timely <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/what-openai-did">What Open AI Did</a> post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Likely the biggest impact of GPT-4o is not technical, but a business decision: soon everyone, whether they are paying or not, will get access to GPT-4o1. I think this is a big deal. When I talk with groups and ask people to raise their hands if they use ChatGPT, almost every hand goes up. When I ask if they used GPT-4, only 5% of hands remain up, at most. GPT-4 is so, so much better than free ChatGPT-3.5, it is like having a PhD student work with you instead of a high school sophomore. But that $20 a month barrier kept many people from understanding how impressive AI can be, and for gaining any benefit from AI. That is no longer true.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then speculates how this change will impact significant areas such as education, work, and global entrepreneurship.</p>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very fast to build something that&amp;rsquo;s 90% of a solution. The problem is that the last 10% of building something is usually the hard part which really matters, and with a black box at the center of the product, it feels much more difficult to me to nail that remaining 10%. Closing that gap with gen AI feels much more fickle to me than a normal engineering problem. It could be that I&amp;rsquo;m unfamiliar with it, but I also wonder if some classes of generative AI based products are just doomed to mediocrity as a result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Molly White&amp;rsquo;s experience with LLMs corresponds more or less with my own, but she is much better at recounting, critiquing, and drawing conclusions than I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find my feelings about AI are actually pretty similar to my feelings about blockchains: &lt;strong&gt;they do a poor job of much of what people try to do with them, they can&amp;rsquo;t do the things their creators claim they one day might, and many of the things they are well suited to do may not be altogether that beneficial&lt;/strong&gt;. And while I do think that AI tools are more broadly useful than blockchains, they also come with similarly monstrous costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I find my feelings about AI are actually pretty similar to my feelings about blockchains: <strong>they do a poor job of much of what people try to do with them, they can&rsquo;t do the things their creators claim they one day might, and many of the things they are well suited to do may not be altogether that beneficial</strong>. And while I do think that AI tools are more broadly useful than blockchains, they also come with similarly monstrous costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the reality is that you can&rsquo;t build a hundred-billion-dollar industry around a technology that&rsquo;s kind of useful, mostly in mundane ways, and that boasts perhaps small increases in productivity if and only if the people who use it fully understand its limitations. And you certainly can&rsquo;t justify the kind of exploitation, extraction, and environmental cost that the industry has been mostly getting away with, in part because people have believed their lofty promises of someday changing the world.</p></blockquote>

      <title>ChatGPT is the perfect Linux assistant</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent the day doing remote maintenance on multiple Linux machines via ssh. The
revelation is that ChatGPT is the bomb for these tasks: What does that command
option do? I am trying to remember. What syntax is to install that peculiar and
rarely used package on Debian? I am getting this locale configuration error;
what was the fix again? All this stuff is answered much sooner than searching
online, no matter the search engine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The feeling is having a good, untiring Linux connoisseur (and of all the various
ancillary packages) sitting right next to you, always ready to lend a hand. I
also think, and I&rsquo;m probably wrong (but my experience seems to bear this out so
far), that because these are all simple questions about stuff well carved in
stone, hallucinations are unlikely to occur.</p>
<p>My assistant today was ChatGPT 3.5, which is very old by today&rsquo;s LLM standards.
It is also free to use, which makes it all even more impressive.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s OpenAI launch of Sora is, as is always the case with OpenAI, mind-boggling. Marquees Browniee&amp;rsquo;s comment is spot-on, so much so as he&amp;rsquo;s obviously involved in the video-making scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think content creators are at risk with Sora, not anytime soon, but, as Marquees repeatedly notes in the video above, just one year ago we thought AI-generated video was a joke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ethan Mollick&#39;s first impressions on Gemini Advanced</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan Mollick, one of my few &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/some-hints-about-what-the-next-year-of-ai-looks-like/&#34;&gt;LLM/AI
sources&lt;/a&gt;, just dropped
his first impressions on Gemini Advanced, released today, but which he&amp;rsquo;s been
testing for a month in early access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start with the headline: Gemini Advanced is clearly a GPT-4 class
model. The statistics show this, but so does a month of our informal testing.
And this is a big deal because OpenAI’s GPT-4 (the paid version of
ChatGPT/Microsoft Copilot) has been the dominant AI for well over a year, and no
other model has come particularly close. Prior to Gemini, we only had one
advanced AI model to look at, and it is hard drawing conclusions with a dataset
of one. Now there are two, and we can learn a few things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

provide short, insightful summaries of YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wasted some time watching a youtube video, that got you kind of

nothing more BUT click-bait? Or have you ever wanted to just quickly recall what
a video that you&amp;rsquo;ve watched some time ago was about? Just Tell Me has you

<p>You can run it from the website or

with your OpenAPI key and the LLM model of choice. I have not looked at the

      <title>Some hints about what the next year of AI looks like</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Professor Ethan Mollick&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/signs-and-portents&#34;&gt;Signs and
Portents&lt;/a&gt; analyzes what AI
has achieved, what the effects have been so far, and what we might expect in
2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ground ourselves, we can start with two quotes that should inform any
estimates about the future. The first is Amara&amp;rsquo;s Law: &amp;ldquo;We tend to overestimate
the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the
long run.&amp;rdquo; Social change is slower than technological change. We should not
expect to see immediate global effects of AI in a major way, no matter how fast
its adoption (and it is remarkably fast), yet we certainly will see it sooner
than many people think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Simon Wilson, who&amp;rsquo;s recently been my go-to person for all AI-related stuff, has
an excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/31/ai-in-2023/&#34;&gt;2023 AI
round-up&lt;/a&gt; on his website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 was the breakthrough year for Large Language Models (LLMs). I think it&amp;rsquo;s
OK to call these AI—they&amp;rsquo;re the latest and (currently) most &amp;ldquo;interesting
development in the academic field of Artificial Intelligence that dates back to
the 1950s. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt to round up the highlights in one place!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The links contained within the post are also valuable. You may know Simon&amp;rsquo;s
website if you are interested in LLMs and AI. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, I suggest you start
following him, preferably via his RSS feed like real hackers do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always struggle a bit with I&amp;rsquo;m asked about the &amp;ldquo;hallucination problem&amp;rdquo; in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the LLM&amp;rsquo;s hazy recollection of its training documents, most of the time the result goes someplace useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only when the dreams go into deemed factually incorrect territory that we label it a &amp;ldquo;hallucination&amp;rdquo;. It looks like a bug, but it&amp;rsquo;s just the LLM doing what it always does.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intro to Large Language Models (video)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andrej Karpathy has a very well-done &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/zjkBMFhNj_g?si=5tJNFaDcK-FBWnWK&#34;&gt;Intro to Large Language Models&lt;/a&gt;
video on YouTube. As a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI and with a two-year hiatus working on Tesla
Autopilot, Karpathy is an authority in the field. He is also good at explaining hard things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Kahneman reader, I appreciated the &lt;em&gt;Thinking Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt; analogy proposed at about half-length in the video:
&amp;ldquo;System 1&amp;rdquo; (fast automatic thinking, rapid decisions) is where we&amp;rsquo;re now; &amp;ldquo;System 2&amp;rdquo; (rational, slow thinking, complex
decisions) is LLMs next goal. Also, I suspect Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s intriguing idea of LLMs as the center of a new &amp;ldquo;operating
system style&amp;rdquo; is not too far off from what will emerge soon. The final segment on AI security and known attack vectors
(jailbreaking, prompt injection, data poisoning) is also super interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newsminimalist.com&#34;&gt;Minimalist News&lt;/a&gt; is the first LLM project that excites me but in a nervous way. Quoting the About page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only publish significant news. To find them we use AI (ChatGPT-4) to read and analyze 1000 top news every day. For
each article it estimates magnitude, scale, potential and credibility. Then we combine these estimates to get the
final Significance score from 0 to 10. And now the best part: We&amp;rsquo;ll only send you the news scored 6.5 or higher.
Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s 5 articles, sometimes 2, sometimes 8. And sometimes — none at all. But one thing is constant — you can
be sure that you haven&amp;rsquo;t missed anything important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The concept is brilliant and well executed, but I can&rsquo;t help but feel uncomfortable at the notion of an AI curating news
for me. Yet, this is the best use case for LLM/AI I&rsquo;ve seen until now.</p>
