      <description>Simon Willison has a new article explaining an important and often ununderstood aspect of LLMs. There&amp;rsquo;s a remarkable difference between chatting with an LLM, as we users do, and training it.
Short version: ChatGPT and other similar tools do not directly learn from and memorize everything that you say to them.
Every time you start a new chat conversation, you clear the slate. Each conversation is an entirely new sequence, carried out entirely independently of previous conversations from both yourself and other users.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Every time you start a new chat conversation, you clear the slate. Each
conversation is an entirely new sequence, carried out entirely independently of
previous conversations from both yourself and other users. Understanding this is
key to working effectively with these models. Every time you hit “new chat” you
are effectively wiping the short-term memory of the model, starting again from
scratch. This has a number of important consequences.</p>

      <title>What Open AI just did</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/what-open-ai-just-did/</link>

      <description>Open AI just released ChatGPT 4o. The launch demo is available on YouTube, and yes, it is impressive. They did not launch v5, though, and 4o is only incremental, not exponential, as v4 has been compared to its predecessor. It may mean we&amp;rsquo;re at the end of the &amp;ldquo;exponential growth&amp;rdquo; phase of LLM models.
However, the most critical aspect of this release is not technical, as Ethan Mollick correctly pinpoints in his timely What Open AI Did post:</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Open AI just released ChatGPT 4o. The launch demo is available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw">YouTube</a>, and yes, it is impressive. They did not launch v5, though, and 4o is only incremental, not exponential, as v4 has been compared to its predecessor. It may mean we&rsquo;re at the end of the &ldquo;exponential growth&rdquo; phase of LLM models.</p>
<p>However, the most critical aspect of this release is not technical, as Ethan Mollick correctly pinpoints in his timely <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/what-openai-did">What Open AI Did</a> post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Likely the biggest impact of GPT-4o is not technical, but a business decision: soon everyone, whether they are paying or not, will get access to GPT-4o1. I think this is a big deal. When I talk with groups and ask people to raise their hands if they use ChatGPT, almost every hand goes up. When I ask if they used GPT-4, only 5% of hands remain up, at most. GPT-4 is so, so much better than free ChatGPT-3.5, it is like having a PhD student work with you instead of a high school sophomore. But that $20 a month barrier kept many people from understanding how impressive AI can be, and for gaining any benefit from AI. That is no longer true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then speculates how this change will impact significant areas such as education, work, and global entrepreneurship.</p>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s very fast to build something that&amp;rsquo;s 90% of a solution. The problem is that the last 10% of building something is usually the hard part which really matters, and with a black box at the center of the product, it feels much more difficult to me to nail that remaining 10%. Closing that gap with gen AI feels much more fickle to me than a normal engineering problem. It could be that I&amp;rsquo;m unfamiliar with it, but I also wonder if some classes of generative AI based products are just doomed to mediocrity as a result.</description>

      <description>Molly White&amp;rsquo;s experience with LLMs corresponds more or less with my own, but she is much better at recounting, critiquing, and drawing conclusions than I am.
I find my feelings about AI are actually pretty similar to my feelings about blockchains: they do a poor job of much of what people try to do with them, they can&amp;rsquo;t do the things their creators claim they one day might, and many of the things they are well suited to do may not be altogether that beneficial.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>I find my feelings about AI are actually pretty similar to my feelings about blockchains: <strong>they do a poor job of much of what people try to do with them, they can&rsquo;t do the things their creators claim they one day might, and many of the things they are well suited to do may not be altogether that beneficial</strong>. And while I do think that AI tools are more broadly useful than blockchains, they also come with similarly monstrous costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the reality is that you can&rsquo;t build a hundred-billion-dollar industry around a technology that&rsquo;s kind of useful, mostly in mundane ways, and that boasts perhaps small increases in productivity if and only if the people who use it fully understand its limitations. And you certainly can&rsquo;t justify the kind of exploitation, extraction, and environmental cost that the industry has been mostly getting away with, in part because people have believed their lofty promises of someday changing the world.</p>

      <title>ChatGPT is the perfect Linux assistant</title>

      <description>I spent the day doing remote maintenance on multiple Linux machines via ssh. The revelation is that ChatGPT is the bomb for these tasks: What does that command option do? I am trying to remember. What syntax is to install that peculiar and rarely used package on Debian? I am getting this locale configuration error; what was the fix again? All this stuff is answered much sooner than searching online, no matter the search engine.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent the day doing remote maintenance on multiple Linux machines via ssh. The
revelation is that ChatGPT is the bomb for these tasks: What does that command
option do? I am trying to remember. What syntax is to install that peculiar and
rarely used package on Debian? I am getting this locale configuration error;
what was the fix again? All this stuff is answered much sooner than searching
online, no matter the search engine.</p>
<p>The feeling is having a good, untiring Linux connoisseur (and of all the various
ancillary packages) sitting right next to you, always ready to lend a hand. I
also think, and I&rsquo;m probably wrong (but my experience seems to bear this out so
far), that because these are all simple questions about stuff well carved in
stone, hallucinations are unlikely to occur.</p>
<p>My assistant today was ChatGPT 3.5, which is very old by today&rsquo;s LLM standards.
It is also free to use, which makes it all even more impressive.</p>

      <description>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s OpenAI launch of Sora is, as is always the case with OpenAI, mind-boggling. Marquees Browniee&amp;rsquo;s comment is spot-on, so much so as he&amp;rsquo;s obviously involved in the video-making scene.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think content creators are at risk with Sora, not anytime soon, but, as Marquees repeatedly notes in the video above, just one year ago we thought AI-generated video was a joke.</description>

      <description>Ethan Mollick, one of my few LLM/AI sources, just dropped his first impressions on Gemini Advanced, released today, but which he&amp;rsquo;s been testing for a month in early access.
Let me start with the headline: Gemini Advanced is clearly a GPT-4 class model. The statistics show this, but so does a month of our informal testing. And this is a big deal because OpenAI’s GPT-4 (the paid version of ChatGPT/Microsoft Copilot) has been the dominant AI for well over a year, and no other model has come particularly close.</description>

      <description>Just Tell Me cleverly leverages ChatGPT to provide short, insightful summaries of YouTube videos.
Have you ever wasted some time watching a youtube video, that got you kind of interested because of the click-baity topic, but in the end turned out to be nothing more BUT click-bait? Or have you ever wanted to just quickly recall what a video that you&amp;rsquo;ve watched some time ago was about? Just Tell Me has you covered!</description>

      <description>Professor Ethan Mollick&amp;rsquo;s Signs and Portents analyzes what AI has achieved, what the effects have been so far, and what we might expect in 2024.
To ground ourselves, we can start with two quotes that should inform any estimates about the future. The first is Amara&amp;rsquo;s Law: &amp;ldquo;We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.&amp;rdquo; Social change is slower than technological change.</description>

its adoption (and it is remarkably fast), yet we certainly will see it sooner

<p>It&rsquo;s an insightful read that pairs well with Simon Wilson&rsquo;s <a href="/stuff-we-figured-out-about-ai-in-2023/">2023

      <description>Simon Wilson, who&amp;rsquo;s recently been my go-to person for all AI-related stuff, has an excellent 2023 AI round-up on his website.
2023 was the breakthrough year for Large Language Models (LLMs). I think it&amp;rsquo;s OK to call these AI—they&amp;rsquo;re the latest and (currently) most &amp;ldquo;interesting development in the academic field of Artificial Intelligence that dates back to the 1950s. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt to round up the highlights in one place!</description>

      <description>I always struggle a bit with I&amp;rsquo;m asked about the &amp;ldquo;hallucination problem&amp;rdquo; in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.
We direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the LLM&amp;rsquo;s hazy recollection of its training documents, most of the time the result goes someplace useful.
It&amp;rsquo;s only when the dreams go into deemed factually incorrect territory that we label it a &amp;ldquo;hallucination&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Andrej Karpathy has a very well-done Intro to Large Language Models video on YouTube. As a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI and with a two-year hiatus working on Tesla Autopilot, Karpathy is an authority in the field. He is also good at explaining hard things.
As a Kahneman reader, I appreciated the Thinking Fast and Slow analogy proposed at about half-length in the video: &amp;ldquo;System 1&amp;rdquo; (fast automatic thinking, rapid decisions) is where we&amp;rsquo;re now; &amp;ldquo;System 2&amp;rdquo; (rational, slow thinking, complex decisions) is LLMs next goal.</description>

<p>As a Kahneman reader, I appreciated the <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> analogy proposed at about half-length in the video:
&ldquo;System 1&rdquo; (fast automatic thinking, rapid decisions) is where we&rsquo;re now; &ldquo;System 2&rdquo; (rational, slow thinking, complex
decisions) is LLMs next goal. Also, I suspect Karpathy&rsquo;s intriguing idea of LLMs as the center of a new &ldquo;operating
system style&rdquo; is not too far off from what will emerge soon. The final segment on AI security and known attack vectors
(jailbreaking, prompt injection, data poisoning) is also super interesting.</p>
<p>On his website, Karpathy also has a promising <a href="https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html">zero-to-hero video series</a>, &ldquo;a
course on building neural networks from scratch, in code.&rdquo;</p>

We only publish significant news. To find them we use AI (ChatGPT-4) to read and analyze 1000 top news every day. For each article it estimates magnitude, scale, potential and credibility. Then we combine these estimates to get the final Significance score from 0 to 10. And now the best part: We&amp;rsquo;ll only send you the news scored 6.</description>
