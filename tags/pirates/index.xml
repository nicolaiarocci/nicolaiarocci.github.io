&lt;p&gt;In 1701, in Middletown, New Jersey, Moses Butterworth languished in a jail,
accused of piracy. Like many young men based in England or her colonies, he
had joined a crew that sailed the Indian Ocean intent on plundering ships of
the Muslim Mughal Empire. Throughout the 1690s, these pirates marauded
vessels laden with gold, jewels, silk, and calico on pilgrimage toward Mecca.
After achieving great success, many of these men sailed back into the
Atlantic via Madagascar to the North American seaboard, where they quietly
disembarked in Charleston, Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York City, Newport,
and Boston, and made themselves at home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
