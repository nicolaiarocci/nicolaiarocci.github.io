      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quoting &lt;a href=&#34;https://dri.es/if-a-note-can-be-public-it-should-be&#34;&gt;Dries Buytaert&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I quietly adopted a small principle that has changed how I think about publishing on my website. [&amp;hellip;] The principle is: If a note can be public, it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconsciously, I am trying to do the same, as you might have noticed by the increased frequency of activity on this website. Maintaining consistency can be challenging, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blogs are still a thing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quoting &lt;a href=&#34;http://82mhz.net/posts/2025/06/blogs-are-still-a-thing/&#34;&gt;Andreas&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is a small niche these days. There isn&amp;rsquo;t much hype around it, nor is there any money to be made because the VC firms are all busy chasing the next big thing, whatever that might be once the AI hype dies off in a year or two. But it is still here, and I like it exactly because it&amp;rsquo;s not the hype technology of the day anymore. It isn&amp;rsquo;t commercialised, algorithmically curated and set up to make some other person rich.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A new golden era of blogging?</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/a-new-golden-era-of-blogging/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/a-new-golden-era-of-blogging/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/the-20-year-indie-web-cycle-maybe/&#34;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s, another article on the
modern era of blogging surfaced on my RSS feed. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/golden-era-blogging/&#34;&gt;A Golden Era of
Blogging&lt;/a&gt;, Jim Nielsen
boldly proposes that we live in, you guessed it, a new golden era of blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argues that the advent of the ads market tainted the original blogging scene
in the mid-2000s, and something similar is now happening in the YouTube scene.
Today&amp;rsquo;s independent blogger is not in it for the money (there&amp;rsquo;s none to be had)
but for passion and an (unconscious?) belief in indie web ideals, and these are
precisely the forces that drove the first wave of bloggers in the 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We modern bloggers, however, inhabit a tiny self-indulging bubble that is not
comparable with the original scene. But you know what, I feel comfortable in it.</p>
