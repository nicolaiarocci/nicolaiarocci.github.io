      <description>An excellent article on Web3 has just appeared on Moxie Marlinspike&amp;rsquo;s website. Being Moxie1, he&amp;rsquo;s not just speculating and rambling about stuff. In an attempt to learn more about the so-called Web3 and the technologies around it, he went all-in and built a couple of dApps himself. Then, he produced an NFT and put it up for sale. What he found is, well, to put it mildly, fascinating.
Some of his insights on technology are also interesting.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An excellent article on Web3 has <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">just appeared</a> on Moxie Marlinspike&rsquo;s
website. Being Moxie<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, he&rsquo;s not just speculating and rambling about stuff.
In an attempt to learn more about the so-called Web3 and the technologies
around it, he went all-in and built a couple of dApps himself. Then, he
produced an NFT and put it up for sale. What he found is, well, to put it
mildly, fascinating.</p>
<p>Some of his insights on technology are also interesting. For example, on
distributed vs. centralized systems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A protocol moves much more slowly than a platform. After 30+ years, email is
still unencrypted; meanwhile WhatsApp went from unencrypted to full e2ee in
a year. People are still trying to standardize sharing a video reliably over
IRC; meanwhile, Slack lets you create custom reaction emoji based on your
face. This isn’t a funding issue. If something is truly decentralized, it
becomes very difficult to change, and often remains stuck in time. That is
a problem for technology, because the rest of the ecosystem is moving very
quickly, and if you don’t keep up you will fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His point on the urgency to reduce the burden of building software is also
poignant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point, software projects require an enormous amount of human effort.
Even relatively simple apps require a group of people to sit in front of
a computer for eight hours a day, every day, forever. This wasn’t always the
case, and there was a time when 50 people working on a software project
wasn’t considered a “small team.” As long as software requires such concerted
energy and so much highly specialized human focus, I think it will have the
tendency to serve the interests of the people sitting in that room every day
rather than what we may consider our broader goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My foray into cryptocurrencies and blockchain happened almost ten years ago
when the craze started. After a few experiments, I tagged it all as a nerds
game and moved away. Moxie&rsquo;s article served me well in catching up on the whole
scene. Can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m thrilled by what I see.</p>
