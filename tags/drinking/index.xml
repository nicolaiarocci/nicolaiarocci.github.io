&lt;p&gt;On New Years Day of 2022, I stumbled out of bed and immediately lost my
vision, fell to the floor, and had to get my then-partner to help me back
into bed. This wasn’t the first time this had happened, and I knew what it
was straight away - I was having a migraine. In the previous decade I’d had
countless migraines, and they always followed the same pattern. I’d wake up
after a night out, attempt to get to the bathroom, lose my vision, and most
likely end up on the floor vomiting from the pain that I can only describe as
feeling like someone trying to hammer a nail into my skull.
The worst part about them? They were avoidable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
