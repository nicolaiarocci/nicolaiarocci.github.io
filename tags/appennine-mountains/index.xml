      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Corezzo, a short hiking loop along the park&amp;rsquo;s oldest mule tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Serra Pass mule track is one of the most fascinating in the entire Casentino territory, if only for the tangible memory of the millions of feet that have trodden, traveled, and worn it down over the centuries. It connected – and still connects – the upper Savio valley with that of Corsalone, branching off from the Romagna valley floor near the Gualchiere (about 2 km south of Bagno di Romagna) and climbing up the Nasseto ridge to reach the summit ridge at a pass that isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly low (1,150 m), but evidently &amp;ldquo;convenient&amp;rdquo; for other reasons, given that its use is documented as early as prehistoric times and experienced an intense period with medieval pilgrimages directed to Rome and later to La Verna.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The Serra Pass mule track is one of the most fascinating in the entire Casentino territory, if only for the tangible memory of the millions of feet that have trodden, traveled, and worn it down over the centuries. It connected – and still connects – the upper Savio valley with that of Corsalone, branching off from the Romagna valley floor near the Gualchiere (about 2 km south of Bagno di Romagna) and climbing up the Nasseto ridge to reach the summit ridge at a pass that isn&rsquo;t exactly low (1,150 m), but evidently &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; for other reasons, given that its use is documented as early as prehistoric times and experienced an intense period with medieval pilgrimages directed to Rome and later to La Verna.</p>
<p>This itinerary follows its best-preserved section, on the Tuscan side, from the mountain hamlet of Serra to the pass of the same name, among remnants of ancient stone paving where one seems to still perceive that &ldquo;incessant wearing of steps&rdquo; of pilgrims who descended from the Alps to reach the hospitals of Serra and Scapruggine, now safe from the dangers and storms of the ridge.</p>

<p>This trip was also an opportunity to take a ride on my motorcycle. The combination of motorcycling and hiking is not easy to pull off, especially with a classic bike like mine, but it&rsquo;s worth it as it combines two of my passions.</p>

      <title>Foresta della Lama</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went hiking in my beloved &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.parcoforestecasentinesi.it/en&#34;&gt;Foreste Casentinesi National Park&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago. This trip has been on my radar for a long time, a circular tour of incomparable beauty among wild environments like very few others in the area. Among the many ways to reach the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.parcoforestecasentinesi.it/en/multimedia/interactive-map/place-to-visit/la-lama&#34;&gt;La Lama&lt;/a&gt;, it is undoubtedly the best way to visit the ancient forests surrounding the beautiful, partly marshy plateau between rocky crags. The initial detour to Mount Penna is motivated by the rare panoramic view, perhaps the most beautiful in the entire park, as if from a wide-open balcony overlooking the sea of forests below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The day was bright and perfect, and everything went well. The highlight of the day was testing the Garmin InReach, and La Lama is the ideal place to test such an item since you have no cell signal. I sent and received text messages via satellite with Serena. The messages are geo-localized. You are no longer isolated; it works anywhere worldwide, and you can issue an SOS call anytime. Garmin will contact Mountain Rescue or equivalent service anywhere. As I have recently re-enrolled in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Alpino_Italiano">CAI</a>, social insurance should also cover any extraction intervention. I am very pleased with this setup; safety has increased dramatically. I have gone and come back on my motorcycle.</p>
