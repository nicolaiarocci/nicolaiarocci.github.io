      <description>I have been following Cowboy Bebop on Netflix (the anime, not the spinoff TV series). The opening is a visual and musical marvel; I&amp;rsquo;m enthralled by it.
The show&amp;rsquo;s soundtrack is a unique blend of jazz (big band hard bop, mainly), blues, and a bit of rock, which I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen before in anime and probably in movies. Even episode titles pay tribute to jazz, blues and rock tracks. We have &amp;ldquo;Valtz for Venus,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Sympathy for the Devil,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;My Funny Valentine,&amp;rdquo; and stuff like that.</description>

<p>The show&rsquo;s soundtrack is a unique blend of jazz (big band hard bop, mainly), blues, and a bit of rock, which I&rsquo;ve never seen before in anime and probably in movies. Even episode titles pay tribute to jazz, blues and rock tracks. We have &ldquo;Valtz for Venus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sympathy for the Devil,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Funny Valentine,&rdquo; and stuff like that. Adorable. Episodes may appear rambling and superficial at first glance, but they are far from that. They strike a perfect balance between comedy and thought-provoking, often philosophical themes.</p>
<p>Last night&rsquo;s episode, &ldquo;Jamming with Edward&rdquo;, struck me as prescient. In 2071, Earth is surrounded by a mountain of scrap metal (mostly decommissioned satellites and wreckage from missiles, probes, and spaceships). Space junk was not a theme in 1998 when the anime was conceived, or was it? And there&rsquo;s this AI, a clear tribute to HAL 9000, left active on a derelict satellite, feeling lonely, misunderstood, and abandoned. It is tremendously timely, resonating with the issues we face today.</p>
<p>I bought the whole Space Cowboy soundtrack. It&rsquo;s the bomb.</p>

      <description>On February 13, 2023, about ten days ago, [Leiji Matsumoto][3] left this world. A phenomenal Japanese manga artist, he created several space operas that influenced me as a kid. Matsumoto directed Space Battleship Yamato1, wrote and illustrated Galaxy Express 9992, and then released the magnificent Space Pirate Captain Harlock. Regarding visual operas, I suspect my fascination with space, astronomy and all things science has much more to do with these three than with the Star Wars movies that came later, or Star Trek.</description>

On February 13, 2023, about ten days ago, [Leiji Matsumoto][3] left this world.
A phenomenal Japanese manga artist, he created several space operas that
influenced me as a kid. Matsumoto directed <em>Space Battleship Yamato</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, wrote
and illustrated <em>Galaxy Express 999</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and then released the magnificent
<em>Space Pirate Captain Harlock</em>. Regarding visual operas, I suspect my
fascination with space, astronomy and all things science has much more to do
with these three than with the Star Wars movies that came later, or Star Trek.</p>
<p>What I did not know until the other day, however, is that Matsumoto worked with
Daft Punk. In 2001, the artist and his studio produced all the videos for Daft
Punk&rsquo;s <em>Discovery</em> album. I distinctly remember watching the <em>One More Time</em>
video and being blown away. It was fantastic and also fascinating in a strange
way, but I couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint the reason. Now I understand. I didn&rsquo;t make the
connection back then, but Matsumoto&rsquo;s touch immediately drew me back to my
childhood fantasies, themselves sprouting from the artist&rsquo;s animes.</p>
<p>In 2003, Toei Animation released <em>Interstella 5555</em>, an &ldquo;animated musical
science fiction film&rdquo; and a visual companion to the <em>Discovery</em> album. It has
no dialogue, minimal sound effects, and all (most?) of <em>Discovery</em>&rsquo;s music. I
watched it this morning and loved every moment of it.</p>

<p>Matsumoto was inspired to create <em>Galaxy Express 999</em> by the idea of a steam train running through the stars in the novel <em>Night on the Galactic Railroad</em> by Kenji Miyazawa.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
