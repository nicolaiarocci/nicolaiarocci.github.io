On February 13, 2023, about ten days ago, [Leiji Matsumoto][3] left this world.
A phenomenal Japanese manga artist, he created several space operas that
influenced me as a kid. Matsumoto directed <em>Space Battleship Yamato</em>[^2], wrote
and illustrated <em>Galaxy Express 999</em>[^1], and then released the magnificent
<em>Space Pirate Captain Harlock</em>. Regarding visual operas, I suspect my
fascination with space, astronomy and all things science has much more to do
with these three than with the Star Wars movies that came later, or Star Trek.</p>
<p>What I did not know until the other day, however, is that Matsumoto worked with
Daft Punk. In 2001, the artist and his studio produced all the videos for Daft
Punk&rsquo;s <em>Discovery</em> album. I distinctly remember watching the <em>One More Time</em>
video and being blown away. It was fantastic and also fascinating in a strange
way, but I couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint the reason. Now I understand. I didn&rsquo;t make the
connection back then, but Matsumoto&rsquo;s touch immediately drew me back to my
childhood fantasies, themselves sprouting from the artist&rsquo;s animes.</p>
<p>In 2003, Toei Animation released <em>Interstella 5555</em>, an &ldquo;animated musical
science fiction film&rdquo; and a visual companion to the <em>Discovery</em> album. It has
no dialogue, minimal sound effects, and all (most?) of <em>Discovery</em>&rsquo;s music. I
watched it this morning and loved every moment of it.</p>
