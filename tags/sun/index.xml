      <description>The Sun as seen by Solar Orbiter in extreme ultraviolet light from a distance of roughly 75 million kilometres. The image is a mosaic of 25 individual images taken on 7 March by the high resolution telescope of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument. Taken at a wavelength of 17 nanometers, in the extreme ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, this image reveals the Sun’s upper atmosphere, the corona, which has a temperature of around a million degrees Celsius.</description>

<p>The Sun as seen by Solar Orbiter in extreme ultraviolet light from a distance
of roughly 75 million kilometres. The image is a mosaic of 25 individual
images taken on 7 March by the high resolution telescope of the Extreme
Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument. Taken at a wavelength of 17 nanometers,
in the extreme ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, this image
reveals the Sun’s upper atmosphere, the corona, which has a temperature of
around a million degrees Celsius.  In total, the final image contains more
than 83 million pixels in a 9148 x 9112 pixel grid, making it the highest
resolution image of the Sun’s full disc and outer atmosphere, the corona,
ever taken.</p>
