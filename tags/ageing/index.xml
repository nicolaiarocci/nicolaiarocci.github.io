      <description>In a new study published in Ageing and Society, researchers Sam Carr and Chao Fang spent over 130 hours interviewing older people to understand what it&amp;rsquo;s like to get old and cope with loneliness. The Conversation UK features their report, appropriately titled Loneliness, loss and regret: what getting old really feels like.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a new study published in Ageing and Society, researchers Sam Carr and Chao
Fang spent over 130 hours interviewing older people to understand what it&rsquo;s
like to get old and cope with loneliness. The Conversation UK features their
report, appropriately titled <a href="https://theconversation.com/loneliness-loss-and-regret-what-getting-old-really-feels-like-new-study-157731">Loneliness, loss and regret: what getting old really
feels like</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that ageing brings about a series of inevitable losses that deeply
challenge people’s sense of connection to the world around them. Loneliness
can often be oversimplified or reduced to how many friends a person has or
how often they see their loved ones.But a particular focus for us was to
better understand what underpins feelings of loneliness in older people on
a deeper level. Researchers have used the term “existential loneliness” to
describe this deeper sense of feeling “separated from the world” – as though
there is an insurmountable gap between oneself and the rest of society. Our
objective was to listen carefully to how people experienced and responded to
this.</p>

<p>A difficult yet worthwhile read.</p>
