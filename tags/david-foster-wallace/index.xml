&lt;p&gt;Cause the technology is just gonna get better and better and it&amp;rsquo;s gonna get easier and easier and more and more convenient and more and more pleasurable to sit alone with images on a screen given to us by people who do not love us but want our money and that&amp;rsquo;s fine in low doses but if it&amp;rsquo;s the basic main staple of your diet you&amp;rsquo;re gonna die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Quoting David Foster Wallace</title>

&lt;p&gt;Because here’s something else that’s true. In the day-to-day trenches of
adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such
thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what
to worship. And an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of God or
spiritual-type thing to worship-be it J.C. or Allah, be it Yahweh or the
Wiccan mother-goddess or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set of
ethical principles-is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you
alive. If you worship money and things-if they are where you tap real meaning
in life-then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It’s the
truth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel
ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths
before they finally plant you. On one level, we all know this stuff
already-it’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, bromides, epigrams,
parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth
up-front in daily consciousness. Worship power-you will feel weak and afraid,
and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay.
Worship your intellect, being seen as smart-you will end up feeling stupid,
a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on.</p></blockquote>
