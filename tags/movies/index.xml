      <description>We watched Hayao Miyazaki&amp;rsquo;s The Boy and the Heron yesterday at the theatre, and I liked it. The official plot goes like this:
A young boy named Mahito yearning for his mother ventures into a world shared by the living and the dead. There, death comes to an end, and life finds a new beginning.
Unsurprisingly, the animation is stunning, and the complex story is beautifully narrated. Mahito Maki, the protagonist, is a kid grappling with inner conflicts and insecurities who recently lost his beloved mother in a dramatic accident.</description>

and I liked it. The official plot goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A young boy named Mahito yearning for his mother ventures into a world shared
by the living and the dead. There, death comes to an end, and life finds a new
beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the animation is stunning, and the complex story is beautifully
narrated. Mahito Maki, the protagonist, is a kid grappling with inner conflicts
and insecurities who recently lost his beloved mother in a dramatic accident.
The fantastic and very &ldquo;Miyazakiest&rdquo; events that unfold once he and his father
reach his mother&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s rural residence will help him cope with his loss.
This movie&rsquo;s central themes are dealing with strife and loss, letting go of
selfishness, and embracing living for and with others. As is often the case with
Miyazaki, while the protagonist is a kid (and a young audience may appreciate
the content, possibly on a more superficial level), the target audience is
adults.</p>
<p>I read that <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> has autobiographical features. Like Mahito,
Miyazaki lost his mother as a kid and was forced to evacuate from the city to
the countryside during the war. His works commonly find children leaving the
city for the rural areas, only to meet the magic and fantastic once they get
there. I cannot help but draw a parallel with J.R.R. Tolkien, who devoted much
of his youth exploring the outskirts of Birmingham with his brother Hillary.
That &ldquo;kind of lost paradise&rdquo; and the rural people who inhabited it were
instrumental in inspiring the Hobbits and Hobbiton&hellip; but I&rsquo;m getting off-topic.</p>

      <description>Yesterday evening, we watched &amp;ldquo;The Vast of the Night&amp;rdquo;, and what a pleasant surprise it was.
One night, in a small New Mexico town, a girl who works at a local radio station and an older reporter boy listen to a recording of some strange noises. Through the radio and its listeners, throughout a single night, they uncover a series of sighting stories that, from clue to clue and radio testimony to radio testimony, bring them close to uncovering something big.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday evening, we watched &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vast_of_Night">The Vast of the
Night</a>&rdquo;, and what a pleasant
surprise it was.</p>
<p>One night, in a small New Mexico town, a girl who works at a local radio station
and an older reporter boy listen to a recording of some strange noises. Through
the radio and its listeners, throughout a single night, they uncover a series of
sighting stories that, from clue to clue and radio testimony to radio testimony,
bring them close to uncovering something big.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive retro soundtrack, and its beauty is the pleasure of the
stories told. At the center of everything always remains the mystery the two
protagonists try to investigate in one night, approaching the truth from
testimony to testimony. A good part of the film lies in the classic elements of
science fiction, namely the discovery (perhaps) of something from another
planet; another part, however, is the creation of the overwhelming sense of
excitement of two people from a small provincial town who increasingly feel they
are part of something important.</p>
<p>The photography, lighting, and camerawork are stellar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the midpoint, Patterson wows with a tracking shot that seems to race a
half-mile down a quiet street, take a left-hook through a parking lot, sprint
through an ongoing basketball game, and zip up the crowded bleachers before
plunging out of a window. It&rsquo;s effective razzle-dazzle that will probably get
the young Oklahoman hired to make something 20 times The Vast of Night&rsquo;s budget.
Yet, the ambition behind it is just as impressive â€“ as is the crew&rsquo;s creativity
at spinning financial limitations into magic.&quot; <br>
&ndash;Amy Nicholson, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/the-vast-of-night-review-1203335505/">Variety</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Vast of the Night&rdquo; is a small, independent, character-driven debut film that
perfectly captures America&rsquo;s province life in the 50s and cleverly leverages
those atmospheres. Inventive and charming, it is also a homage to The Twilight
Zone, The War Of The Worlds (the radio station name is WOTW), and others.</p>
<p>Serena found it slow, especially at the beginning. I can understand that: the
first twenty minutes are a long walk-and-talk between the two protagonists, but
oh boy, look the world-building (and camera work) happening right there!</p>
