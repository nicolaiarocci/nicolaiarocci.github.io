As I was browsing my RSS feed this morning, I came across a [new blog][1] from
Nat Friedman over at GitHub. The piece was titled &ldquo;Open source goes to Mars&rdquo;,
and, of course, it caught my interest. In the article, Nat announced a Mars
2020 Helicopter Mission badge added to GitHub profiles contributing to
open-source projects and libraries used by Ingenuity. Some time ago, like many
others, I was granted the Arctic Code Vault badge, so I am familiar with the
concept. I quickly dismissed the information as &ldquo;nice, not gonna get it&rdquo; and
moved along.</p>
<p>Later during the day, I got a mail from an Eve contributor. In between other
things, he briefly congratulated me on my new GitHub badge. I went to check my
profile, only to find that, indeed, I am a Mars Helicopter Contributor. I was
bewildered. To my knowledge, I never worked on something even remotely related
to the Ingenuity mission.</p>
<p>Years ago, I received a package from a software team at a private space agency
whose name I cannot tell. They sent me a lot of cool swag and a hand-written
letter signed by all team members. In it, I learned that they had been using
one of my open-source projects with success. They added that I should take
pride, as my work was used in one of their renowned space ships projects. The
package was their way to express gratitude. If you&rsquo;ve attended any of my talks
in the past, you probably know this story. You might have seen me wearing one
of their t-shirts too. I knew my work was used in many places; I certainly did
not expect it was contributing to a space ship program.</p>
<p>So when I reached for my profile page on GitHub today, I was confused, yes, but
not wholly unprepared. And indeed, there it is, the new, shiny Mars Helicopter
Contributor badge. A quick investigation revealed that I earned it as a Flask
contributor. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t even remember contributing to it[^2]. I know
I&rsquo;ve used it extensively, of course, as [Eve][4] inherits from and builds on it.</p>

</p>
<p>So, what to make of all of this? I am happy, of course. I have a badge of
honor to show off to my kids later this evening. I appreciate the intent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Many of the people who are getting a badge probably have no idea their
software is being used to fly a helicopter on another planet,” says GitHub
Senior Director of Developer Relations Martin Woodward. “We wanted to make
sure everyone was recognized for their contributions to this incredible human
achievement.” (<a href="https://github.com/readme/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These badges surely help raise awareness of open-source relevance in the
modern-day world. I am grateful for it. I have to say, however, that I am not
a fan of the current gamification process going on at GitHub. I cringed when
I saw the &ldquo;How do you feel today&rdquo; box in my profile page a while ago[^3]. This
Achievements feature looks good on the surface. Still, it leans itself to be
leveraged in many different, even subtle ways. Let&rsquo;s hope for the best.</p>
