      <description>Eve 2.0.2 was just released today. It fixes a problem introduced with v2.0 in which ETag generation failed if uuidRepresentation was not set in MONGO_OPTIONS. See issue #1486 for details. Many thanks @tgm for reporting and then contributing the fix.

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/eve-2.0.1-released/</guid>
      <description>Today I released Eve 2.0.1, which contains an essential fix if you&amp;rsquo;re using MONGO_URI to connect to your MongoDB instance. See the relevant ticket for details. I&amp;rsquo;ve also pinned Flask dependency to v2.1, as v2.2 brings some breaking changes that, you guessed it, break our CI runs. If you think you can help wiht that, please do so. The complete changelog is available here.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to announce that Eve 2 has finally been released today. This release drops support for Python 2, Python 3.5 and Python 3.6 hence the major version bump. Other than that, expect some fixes, a new uuidRepresentation setting for MONGO_OPTIONS, and an alignment to the latest Werkzeug/PyMongo idiosyncrasies. The full changelog is available on the project website.
The Eve project has been out for ten years.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been back at the forge working on Eve 2.0. Version 2 will support Python 3.7+ and drop Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6. It will bring support for PyMongo 4+ as well, along with several other minor fixes and improvements (changelog). It would be nice if you guys and gals, users of Eve, would give it a spin before the release.
I know. I recently stated that Eve was in maintenance mode.</description>

      <description>Tonight someone opened a ticket on the Eve repository. I jotted down a quick reply and was about to hit the Comment button when I thought a more articulated reply was in order. I also want it published on my website.
So the question is:
Is Eve still maintained?
My reply goes like this:
Hello, yes, Eve is in &amp;lsquo;maintenance mode&amp;rsquo;, as I call it. I don&amp;rsquo;t actively develop new features anymore.</description>

      <description>Last February I published The State of Eve REST Framework. Among other things in that post, I mentioned that I was looking for ways that would allow me to allocate more time to the project (and its satellites).
I really feel like I should put more effort into Eve, Cerberus and satellite projects Eve-Swagger, Flask-Sentinel, Eve.NET, etc. I love working on these projects and I know a lot of people rely on them.</description>

      <description>A new major release of the Eve REST API Framework is finally out with a number of cool new features (MongoDB Aggregations!), few fixes, and a couple of minor breaking changes. On the Eve blog you can find a detailed article about this important release.
I am glad to report that the Eve-SQLAlchemy community extension, which allows SQL databases to serve as Eve backends, has seen a surge of activity around it.</description>

      <description>I just released a long overdue update to Eve.NET. This release marks a significant improvement over the previous one, which was more a prototype than a real package. New features are as follows:
PostAsync() supports bulk inserts DeleteAsync() supports bulk deletes GetAsync() has a softDelete option to include soft-deleted documents with query results GetAsync() has a rawQuery option to pass raw Eve queries to the server BearerAuthenticator class adds support for Bearer Token authentication Several fixes made it into this release and, most importantly, I switched to portable Profile259 which offers support for the following platforms: Xamarin.</description>

      <description>Released by the nice folks at Drud, EveGenie is a tool for making Eve schema generation easier.
Eve’s schema definitions are full of features, but can take a good amount of time to create when dealing with lots of complex resources. From our experience, it’s often helpful to describe an endpoint in JSON before creating it as an Eve schema. This allows you to make quick decisions about the structure of your entities without spending time moving schema code around.</description>

      <description>Eve-Swagger is a swagger.io extension for Eve powered RESTful APIs. It has been around for a while on GitHub but I never managed to officially release it. So rejoice! it is now available on PyPI.
But what is Swagger, and why is it useful to your RESTful API? With a Swagger-enabled API you can get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability, all for free. From Swagger website:
Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API.</description>

      <description>On Stack Overflow and the Eve mailing list, but also in my mailbox and even on Twitter, I get a lot of enquiries on how to build custom endpoints within a Eve-powered RESTful application. Now, since within Eve all endpoints are fully customizable, what they really mean is:
How do I setup endpoints without any binding to a data entity, just connected to a custom method?
They would like to call something like /mycustomendpoint and get the response from a method they have defined somewhere in the Python sources.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Cerberus 0.8.1 was released with a few little fixes, one of them being more a new feature than a fix really: sub-document fields can now be set as field dependencies by using a ‘dotted’ notation.
So, suppose we set the following validation schema:
schema = { &#39;test_field&#39;: { &#39;dependencies&#39;: [ &#39;a_dict.foo&#39;, &#39;a_dict.bar&#39; ] }, &#39;a_dict&#39;: { &#39;type&#39;: &#39;dict&#39;, &#39;schema&#39;: { &#39;foo&#39;: {&#39;type&#39;: &#39;string&#39;}, &#39;bar&#39;: {&#39;type&#39;: &#39;string&#39;} } } } Then, we can validate a document like this:</description>

      <description>Flask-Sentinel is a OAuth2 Server implementation of the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant pattern described in Section 1.3.3 of RFC 6749. It is powered by Flask-Oauthlib, Redis and MongoDB and is bundled as a Flask extension so it can be used to add OAuth2 capabilities to an existing application.
So what is the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant pattern? According to the official RFC:
The resource owner password credentials (i.e., username and password) can be used directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access token.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/Eve.NET&#34;&gt;Eve.NET&lt;/a&gt; is a simple HTTP and REST client for Web Services powered by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://python-eve.org&#34;&gt;Eve Framework&lt;/a&gt;. It leverages both &lt;code&gt;System.Net.HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Json.NET&lt;/code&gt; to provide the best possible Eve experience on the .NET platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written and maintained by the same author of the Eve Framework itself, Eve.NET is delivered as a portable library (PCL) and runs seamlessly on .NET4, Mono, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8. We use Eve.NET internally to power our iOS, Web and Windows applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Open Source and Code Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/open-source-and-code-responsibility/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/open-source-and-code-responsibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I was speaking at an Open Source panel at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bettersoftware.it&#34;&gt;Better Software 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the topics that we touched was code responsibility. This is an important topic for anyone who is maintaining an open source project, especially when it comes to the process of reviewing and accepting code contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point during the debate, I argued that when a maintainer merges a pull request, he (or she) implicitly agrees on being responsible for that code. That seemed to strike some surprise into most attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, in theory any contributor is just a ping away so in case trouble arises one can always reach him, or her. Unfortunately this is not always the case. While some contributors will fully embrace your project and keep helping after their initial contribution, truth is that a good number of them will just move on, never to be seen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with that. Not everyone has spare time to devote to your project, which is perfectly fine. It is natural for most people to contribute what they need to a project and then go on their way. Actually, one could argue that most projects grow and prosper precisely thanks to this kind of contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However this attitude can become an incumbent when big chunks of code get merged, usually as new (big) features. Good practices advice against merging huge pull requests. In fact they are rare and when they do come, it is a good idea to ask for them to be split into smaller ones. But no matter the format, a huge contribution is likely to hit a project one day or another. It might even come from more than one person: a disconnected and distributed team of contributors who have been patiently tinkering on a side branch or a fork for example. When this happens, and provided that the contribution is worth merging, the maintainer should then ask him/herself the obvious question: &lt;em&gt;am I willing to deal with the consequences of this merge?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Feature Overview: The Eve OpLog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The operations log or OpLog is a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://python-eve.org&#34;&gt;Eve&lt;/a&gt; feature that I’m currently developing on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/eve/tree/oplog&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;oplog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; experimental branch. It’s supposed to help in addressing a subtle issue that we’ve been dealing with, but I believe it can also emerge as a very useful all-around tool. I am posting about it in the hope of gathering some feedback from Eve contributors and users, so that I can better pinpoint design and implementation before I merge it to the main development branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-oplog&#34;&gt;What is the OpLog?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpLog is a special resource that keeps a record of operations that modify the data stored by the API. Every &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PATCH&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; operation can eventually be recorded by the oplog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core the oplog is simply a server log, something that’s always been on the Eve roadmap. What makes it a little bit different is its ability to be exposed as a read-only API endpoint. This would in turn allow clients to query it as they would with any other standard endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>REST APIs for Humans at FOSDEM</title>

      <description>Yesterday I gave a talk at FOSDEM 2014 in Brussels. The conference itself was amazing, with over 5000 attendees literally swarming and taking over the ULB Campus. I was stoked at how smoothly everything was going on despite the incredible number of simultaneous sessions and the number of attendees continuously flowing between buildings and conference rooms. Everybody involved, volunteers and attendees, has been very welcoming, charming and helpful. In short, I had a blast.</description>

      <title>Cerberus 0.5 is out (and it breaks stuff)</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/cerberus-0-5-is-out-and-it-breaks-stuff/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new release changes the way validation errors are reported. Please note that these changes will also affect future releases of &lt;a href=&#34;http://python-eve.org&#34;&gt;Eve&lt;/a&gt;, the Python REST API Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we had before was basically a list of human-readable errors. Each item in the list, while perfectly fine for human reading, wasn&amp;rsquo;t really ideal for algorithmic parsing. Why would you want to parse the errors with an algorithm? A common case would be when your client is using business objects to represent API resources (think a client-side ORM), and would have a hard time binding validation errors to the objects themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MongoDB and REST API go for a picnic (video and slides)</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/mongodb-rest-api-go-picnic-video-slides/</link>

      <description>I had the opportunity to give my RESTful WeB APIs and MongoDB Go For A Picnic talk at both MongoTorino and NoSQL Day. The folks at PUG Friuli where so nice to record all the NoSQL Day sessions, so here you have it: the full length video of yours truly speaking to a fully packed room crowded with 120 very attentive attendees.
Unfortunately audio is horrible and while all MongoTorino talks were in english, NoSQL Day was an italian-only event.</description>

      <title>Eve v0.0.8 has been released</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/eve-v0-0-8-has-been-released/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/eve-v0-0-8-has-been-released/</guid>
      <description>Most significant features are probably the native support for MongoDB write concern settings, new event hooks allowing for transformation of documents before they are sent to clients, increased handling of both pagination and CORS, and the native validation of float data types.
Get it on PyPI, go straight to the source code or more likely, visit the project homepage.</description>

      <description>E’ passato qualche mese da quando ho annunciato Eve, il REST API framework open source. Nel frattempo il progetto è cresciuto bene: siamo appena giunti alla versione 0.0.6, abbiamo un sito ufficiale, un blog, e stiamo lavorando a nuove feature davvero interessanti.</description>

      <title>Vi presento Eve il framework per le REST API Web</title>

      <description>Lo scorso anno abbiamo lavorato duro per costruirci una RESTful Web API su misura, flessibile e completa. In corso d’opera abbiamo imparato molto sulle migliori pratiche REST, mettendo anche alla frusta le rinomate capacità Web del linguaggio Python.
Ad EuroPython 2012 ho poi raccontato la nostra esperienza e condiviso ciò che avevamo imparato. In quell’occasione mi sono reso conto di quanto l’argomento fosse d’attualità, tanto che da quel 4 luglio le slide che avevo preparato (le trovate su Speaker Deck o Slideshare) ed i video su YouTube (italiano; inglese) hanno totalizzato 30mila visite.</description>
