&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I&amp;rsquo;ve found no greater professional joy than working with a tight group of people to ship and support our own products.

The creative and intellectual stimulation is beyond compare. Especially when you&amp;rsquo;re the first customer for anything you make.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
