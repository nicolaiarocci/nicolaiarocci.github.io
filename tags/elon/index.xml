      <description>As someone who&amp;rsquo;s been on board with Twitter since 2009, I have to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m very concerned with recent developments. I admire and respect Elon Musk for his companies&amp;rsquo; achievements, especially in space and electric movement industries, but the man himself, holy cow, what a drag.
On The Verge, Nilay Patel&amp;rsquo;s brutal piece on the recent Twitter acquisition is chock-full of brilliant insights on what it takes to run a modern commercial social service.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As someone who&rsquo;s been on board with Twitter since 2009, I have to admit that
I&rsquo;m <em>very</em> concerned with recent developments. I admire and respect Elon Musk
for his companies&rsquo; achievements, especially in space and electric movement
industries, but the man himself, holy cow, what a drag.</p>
<p>On The Verge, Nilay Patel&rsquo;s brutal piece on the recent Twitter acquisition is
chock-full of brilliant insights on what it takes to run a modern commercial
social service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You fucked up real good, kiddo. Twitter is a disaster clown car company that
is successful despite itself, and there is no possible way to grow users and
revenue without making a series of enormous compromises that will ultimately
destroy your reputation and possibly cause grievous damage to your other
companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I say this with utter confidence because the problems with Twitter are not
engineering problems. They are political problems. Twitter, the company,
makes very little interesting technology; the tech stack is not the valuable
asset. The asset is the user base: hopelessly addicted politicians,
reporters, celebrities, and other people who should know better but keep
posting anyway. You! You, Elon Musk, are addicted to Twitter. Youâ€™re the
asset. You just bought yourself for $44 billion dollars.</p>
