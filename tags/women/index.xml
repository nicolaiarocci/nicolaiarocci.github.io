      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was walking early this morning, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/early-morning-walks&#34;&gt;as usual&lt;/a&gt;, when I came
across an unusual advertising sign. It was in Spanish, text only, red background and black
typography. I don&amp;rsquo;t comprehend Spanish well enough to read it, so I photographed it
and sent it to Serena, who promptly replied with the translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embarrassingly, just yesterday, I got a severe reprimand from Serena because I did not know or remember what day it was today. When I got back, I traced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.regione.emilia-romagna.it/notizie/approfondimenti/2025/nonsonotua/la-campagna-non-sono-tua&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; and found that the sign is actually available in several languages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
