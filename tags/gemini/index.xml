      <description>Ethan Mollick, one of my few LLM/AI sources, just dropped his first impressions on Gemini Advanced, released today, but which he&amp;rsquo;s been testing for a month in early access.
Let me start with the headline: Gemini Advanced is clearly a GPT-4 class model. The statistics show this, but so does a month of our informal testing. And this is a big deal because OpenAI’s GPT-4 (the paid version of ChatGPT/Microsoft Copilot) has been the dominant AI for well over a year, and no other model has come particularly close.</description>

<p>Let me start with the headline: Gemini Advanced is clearly a GPT-4 class
model. The statistics show this, but so does a month of our informal testing.
And this is a big deal because OpenAI’s GPT-4 (the paid version of
ChatGPT/Microsoft Copilot) has been the dominant AI for well over a year, and no
other model has come particularly close. Prior to Gemini, we only had one
advanced AI model to look at, and it is hard drawing conclusions with a dataset
of one. Now there are two, and we can learn a few things.</p>

<p>Things are getting hotter in the LLM space, and competition is always good.</p>
