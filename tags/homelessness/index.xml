      <description>In Finland, the number of homeless people has fallen sharply. The reason: The country applies the “Housing First” concept. Those affected by homelessness receive a small apartment and counselling – without any preconditions. 4 out of 5 people affected thus make their way back into a stable life. And: All this is cheaper than accepting homelessness.
Finland&amp;rsquo;s take on the homelessness problem is remarkable and gives hope. I live in a small town where the problem is not as apparent as in, say, San Francisco.</description>

<p>Finland&rsquo;s <a href="https://scoop.me/housing-first-finland-homelessness/">take on the homelessness problem</a> is remarkable and gives hope.
I live in a small town where the problem is not as apparent as in, say, San

at the terrifying homelessness situation I met there. There, in San Francisco,
I realized the magnitude of &ldquo;true liberalism&rdquo;&rsquo;s failure.</p>
