      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Moka guy, always have been. Admittedly, I also like so-called American
coffee and, of course, espresso. But every day at my place, I&amp;rsquo;ll have
a Moka-brewed coffee. Twice. As I wake up, and then in the afternoon before
getting back to work. I&amp;rsquo;ve been observing the pods frenzy spreading all around
me with curiosity and bewilderment in recent years, with dedicated retailers
opening (and often closing soon after) everywhere in my town. Bialetti&amp;rsquo;s Moka
coffee pots have always been around my life. Not disposable, for they are
pretty expensive even here in Italy, but common, everyday kitchen gadgets?
Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Absolutely.</p>
<p>So it was interesting to read Atlas Obscura&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/make-coffee-moka-pot">The Humble Brilliance of Italy&rsquo;s
Moka Coffee Pot</a> to learn more about Moka&rsquo;s roots, history (with the ups and
downs), and design relevance. Of all this stuff, I was only marginally aware.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Moka pot is a symbol of Italy: of postwar ingenuity and global culinary
dominance. It is in the Museum of Modern Art, the Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian
Design Museum, and other temples to design. It is in the Guinness Book of
World Records as the world&rsquo;s most popular coffee maker and was for decades
commonplace to the point of ubiquity not only in Italy but in Cuba,
Argentina, Australia, and the United States. It&rsquo;s also widely misunderstood
and maligned, with approval in the modern coffee world coming perhaps a bit
too late, in only the past few years. Get one while you can.</p></blockquote>
