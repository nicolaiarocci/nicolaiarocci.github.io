      <description>Quoting [Nelson&amp;rsquo;s weblog][3]:
Goodreads lost my entire account last week. Nine years as a user, some 600 books and 250 carefully written reviews all deleted and unrecoverable. Their support has not been helpful. In 35 years of being online I&amp;rsquo;ve never encountered a company with such callous disregard for their users&amp;rsquo; data.
Ouch. A lesson learned the hard way:
My plan now is to host my own blog-like collection of all my reading notes like [Tom does][2].</description>

<p>One of the many reasons I don&rsquo;t write my reviews on Goodreads and host them on
my website instead is precisely the risk of losing them all one day[^1]. The same
with Twitter. I have been on Twitter since 2009 and was very active there.
I [witnessed][6] the BBS era. Since then, I&rsquo;ve seen oh-so-many &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo;
services coming and going, I could fill a book.</p>
<p>Tweeting is quicker and faster, yes. So is writing a review on Goodreads. If
I don&rsquo;t feel like opening vim to write something, though, then it&rsquo;s probably
not worth sharing in the first place.</p>
<p>Posting on Goodreads or Twitter grants more visibility, that&rsquo;s for sure.
I understand that clicking a link to leave the platform is an effort that not
everyone is willing to make. I&rsquo;m probably losing followers on Twitter and
&lsquo;friends&rsquo; on Goodreads. That&rsquo;s fine[^5]. Those remaining are likely to be more
interested in my content and, ultimately, in me as a person.</p>
<p>Most of the stuff I write here is meant for myself anyway. If what I write
happens to also be interesting for other readers, that&rsquo;s cool, but it&rsquo;s not the
primary goal. I feel much better now that I own my content. The switch from
social media content production to [POSSE][4] was beneficial and is something
I advise everyone to do.</p>
