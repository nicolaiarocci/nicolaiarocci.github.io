&lt;p&gt;The old timers who built the early web are coding with AI like it&amp;rsquo;s 1995. Think about it: They gave blockchain the sniff test and walked away. Ignored crypto (and yeah, we&amp;rsquo;re not rich now). NFTs got a collective eye roll. But AI? Different story. The same folks who hand-coded HTML while listening to dial-up modems sing are now vibe-coding with the kids. Building things. Breaking things. Giddy about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<blockquote>
<p>We Gen X&rsquo;ers have seen enough gold rushes to know the real thing. This one&rsquo;s got all the usual crap—bad actors, inflated claims, VCs throwing money at anything with &ldquo;AI&rdquo; in the pitch deck. Gross behavior all around. Normal for a paradigm shift, but still gross.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The people who helped wire up the internet recognize what&rsquo;s happening. When the folks who&rsquo;ve been through every tech cycle since gopher start acting like excited newbies again, that tells you something.</p></blockquote>
