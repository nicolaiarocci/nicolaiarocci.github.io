      <description>Yesterday was a beautiful, sunny, cold winter Sunday. I felt like going out and enjoying nature, so I took a solo hike in the Foreste Casentinesi National Park, about an hour&amp;rsquo;s drive from home.
This one marks my very first technology-assisted hiking adventure. It may seem weird for someone who&amp;rsquo;s been hiking for so long, is a notorious geek and is a professional computer programmer to have never used technology before.</description>
