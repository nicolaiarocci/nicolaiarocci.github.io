&lt;p&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons played an outsize role in popularizing fantasy literature,
ideas, and themes, as well as inspiring many of its devotees to create their
own. Roleplaying, as a formal activity, owes nearly its entire existence to the
phenomenal success of D&amp;amp;D. Even more remarkable is the extent to which the
computer and video game industry, which is bigger and more profitable than the
music and movie industries combined, owes a huge debt to the example set by D&amp;amp;D.
If you play any game with classes or levels or experience or hit points today,
that&amp;rsquo;s because of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I started playing D&amp;D in high school in the mid-80s. Does that make me a
Stranger Things kid? I&rsquo;m still trying to figure that out, but D&amp;D significantly
impacted me growing up. It probably didn&rsquo;t save my life <a href="https://www.hearsay.tech/2023-10-29-dungeons-and-dragons-saved-my-life.gmi">like it did for
others</a>,
but to an introvert like me, it offered an incredible opportunity to go out,
meet and talk to people, challenging myself and my imagination.</p>
<p>Right before Christmas, I presented myself with an AD&amp;D 5th edition complete
set, partly out of curiosity but also nostalgia. I loved browsing the modern
editions of the Player Handbook, Master Manual, and Monsters Bookâ€”so many good
memories. I later bought the Starter Kit, hoping to play at least an evening
session with my &ldquo;kids,&rdquo; as two of them were about to return home from University
(the third is still with us.) We never played that session. In hindsight, it was
a stupid idea.</p>
