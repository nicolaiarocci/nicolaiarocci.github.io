      <description>Would it be possible (and advisable) for a person to deal with everyday matters as if he/she was a stateless machine?

<p>This is what our lives are like. We are constantly holding information, frustration, ideas, tension, requests, needs, of a thousand different requests each day. Every email, every call, every text message, every open browser tab, every interaction with another person, every task we do â€¦ it all builds up in us until we are overloaded.</p>
