      <description>This year I&amp;rsquo;ve read twenty-one books or 5903 pages. That&amp;rsquo;s fewer books than last year (28 / 8064), the year before (25 / 8394), and the one before that (30 / 8447). Heck, I must look back at 2014 to score a win in my very own yearly reading challenge. What surprises me is not much the number of books but the pages I read, which constitutes a more relevant metric.</description>

      <description>Here are five books I read in 2020 that I would recommend. I read several fine books last year, so please check out my reading history if you are unsatisfied with this selection.
Mani: Travels in the Southern Peloponnese, by Patrick Leigh Fermor. I love Patrick Leigh Fermor. Over the years, I read almost everything he wrote. He has been described as &amp;ldquo;a cross between Indiana Jones, James Bond, and Graham Greene,&amp;rdquo; and for a good reason.</description>
