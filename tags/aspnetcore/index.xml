      <description>Today I learned the hard way that since ASP.NET Core 2.0, the request body has acquired a default size limit at 30MB (~28.6 MiB).
If the request body size exceeds the configured max request body size limit, the call to Request.Body.ReadAsync will throw an IOException. If this exception is uncaught, Kestrel will respond with a 413 Payload Too Large response and HttpSys will respond with a generic 500 Internal Server Error response ([source][1]).</description>

<p>This will be a breaking change if your endpoint is expected to handle large
uploads. The solution is simple, just decorate your MVC action or controller
with the <code>RequestSizeLimit</code> attribute, like so:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>    [HttpPost]
    [RequestSizeLimit(100_000_000)]
    public IActionResult MyAction([FromBody] MyViewModel data)
    {
</code></pre><p><code>DisableRequestSizeLimit</code> can be used to make request size unlimited. This
effectively restores pre-2.0.0 behavior for just the attributed action or
controller. You can also change or disable the limit programmatically, either
on a per-request basis or globally (see the instructions at this [link][1].)</p>
<p>In my case, however, disabling the request limit was not enough. Because my
endpoint is expecting an <code>IFormFile</code> argument, I also had to set the
<code>RequestFormLimits</code> attribute:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>    [HttpPost]
    [DisableRequestSizeLimit,
    RequestFormLimits(MultipartBodyLengthLimit = int.MaxValue, 
        ValueLengthLimit = int.MaxValue)]
    public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; BulkAdd(string schema, IFormFile file)
    {
</code></pre><p>Please note that all of this happened on a .NET 5 Linux application with
Kestrel running behind nginx. As pointed out at the link above, if you&rsquo;re
running behind IIS, then the limit is disabled, and the usual <em>web.config</em>
limit applies.</p>
<p>For future reference, [here][2] are the current Kestrel limits.</p>
