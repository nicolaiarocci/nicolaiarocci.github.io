      <description>Today I upgraded to JetBrains&amp;rsquo; Rider 2022.3. Startup speed has been enhanced, and full .NET 7 and C# 11 support is included. So far, my favorite feature is the conversion of regular and verbatim strings into their raw counterparts (it&amp;rsquo;s often the small, simple things.)
My second best is the fulls upport for WSL2 remote development. This one took a good while to come out of the trenches, but better late than never, I&amp;rsquo;d say.</description>

<p>My second best is the fulls upport for WSL2  remote development. This one took a

<p>And the new experimental UI? That&rsquo;s neat too.</p>

      <description>While it has been a very challenging and difficult time for the company, it cannot even remotely be compared with the horrendous situation that the people of Ukraine are facing on a daily basis, caused by the war. Once again, we condemn this aggression, and have and will continue to stand by the people of Ukraine, including our colleagues and their families. More here.

<p>I&rsquo;m using JetBrains products when I&rsquo;m not in (neo)vim. For C#, Rider is
fantastic, and so is PyCharm for Python. The company is incredible, too, as
today&rsquo;s bold move demonstrates. They moved 800 employees, got visas, new
locations and apartments, everything. Huge respect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have been awarded their <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/#support">Open Source License</a> for many
years, so I&rsquo;m biased, but look, now I&rsquo;m even proud of supporting their products
