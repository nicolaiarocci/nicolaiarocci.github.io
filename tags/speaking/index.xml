      <description>I am speaking about OAuth2 and Open ID Connect with ASP.NET Core 8 at Rome .NET Conference 2024 on March 22 and then, less than a week later, at WebDay 2024 in Milan.
I am always particularly excited when I can present the stuff I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on. Being forced to share as I learn encourages me to go deeper into the topic to reinforce my comprehension and better explain it to the audience—a win-win situation.</description>

      <description>The video and slides of my C# 12 session at .NET Conference Italia 2023 is finally available online. Unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s just my voice and my laptop screen, and that&amp;rsquo;s too bad because the location was as cool as it can get, and the room was packed.
It is in Italian1 and you need to login in order to see it (sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t have control over it.)
I also submitted to several international conferences; let&amp;rsquo;s see what happens.</description>

      <description>In a few days, on Monday, December 4, at 10 a.m., I will present at the .NET Conference Italia 2023, which will be held at the Microsoft House in Milan. My session is titled &amp;ldquo;C#12 What&amp;rsquo;s new and interesting&amp;rdquo; and is part of a rich agenda focused on the recent release of .NET 8.
I presented on the same subject at a DevRomagna meetup a few months ago when C# 12 was in preview and still had several moving parts.</description>

<p>I presented on the same subject at a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/devromagna/">DevRomagna</a> meetup a few months ago when C# 12 was in preview and still had
several moving parts. Now that the final release is out, it will be interesting to return to the topic to consolidate my
knowledge. I suspect that of the many reasons I challenge myself to speak publicly, enriching my knowledge is prevalent.
As the adage goes, for learning a subject, nothing beats explaining it in front of a knowledgeable audience.</p>
<p>If you will attend the conference (you should!), remember to meet me and say hi!</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> the session is now <a href="/video-of-my-csharp-12-session-at-dotnet-conference-italia-2023/">available online</a>.</p>

      <description>On Thursday, I will be speaking in Milan at WebDay 2023. Mine is a hands-on session on building a reliable and continuous end-to-end testing environment for web apps using Microsoft Playwright. If you attended my introductory Playwright session at WPC last year, Thursday&amp;rsquo;s session would be the ideal follow-up to that one, as I only briefly touched on CI deployments there.
Drawing from my experience doing the whole thing in production, I&amp;rsquo;ll essentially be live testing a Blazor app, then take the entire thing to remote CI via GitHub Actions.</description>

solved them, and offer some practices we adopted.</p>
<p>WebDay 2023 will be a hybrid event, with over 380 in-person attendees and almost 1300 registered for live streaming.
After the exhilarating experience of being back on an actual stage at WPC a few months ago, I&rsquo;m excited to speak once
again in front of a real crowd.</p>

      <title>On the state of developer conferences</title>

      <description>Brian Rinaldi has an insightful post on his blog about the current state of developer conferences, where &amp;lsquo;current state&amp;rsquo; means post-COVID pandemic. Brian is well-positioned to reason about this space as a long-time conference organizer. I appreciate that he also takes the time to explain how the developer conference business works. The core of his blog is about post-pandemic conference attendance, which has plunged.
independent, in-person developer conferences are hurting. Based on my own observation as well as talks with organizers and sponsors that I have come to know over the years, the average independent in-person event is still down 30-40% from pre-pandemic attendance levels.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian Rinaldi has an insightful post on <a href="https://remotesynthesis.com/blog/developer-conferences/">his blog</a> about the current state of
developer conferences, where &lsquo;current state&rsquo; means post-COVID pandemic. Brian
is well-positioned to reason about this space as a long-time conference
organizer. I appreciate that he also takes the time to explain how the
developer conference business works. The core of his blog is about
post-pandemic conference attendance, which has plunged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>independent, in-person developer conferences are hurting. Based on my own
observation as well as talks with organizers and sponsors that I have come to
know over the years, the average independent in-person event is still down
30-40% from pre-pandemic attendance levels. And often it seems to require
massive discounts or even giveaways to get to this level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he offers an interesting theory on why that is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My hypothesis is that we’ve bifurcated the audience somewhat. The folks that
were there almost exclusively for the content have decided that they can do
so more cheaply and efficiently online via virtual conferences or recordings.
The folks that went for the networking as a primary driver, on the other
hand, are largely eschewing online events as not fulfilling their needs.
[&hellip;] So ultimately what we are left with is a lower in-person audience and a
lower virtual audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a conference speaker and meetup organizer, I noticed that online events saw
low attendance during the pandemic, and they still do today. When available,
recordings partially compensate, but only in audience terms. The problem is
online events are not conferences. &lsquo;Conference&rsquo; originates from the late Latin
&ldquo;conferentia,&rdquo; itself a derivative of &ldquo;conferre,&rdquo; a synonym for the collation
of &ldquo;bring together&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A conference is a meeting to discuss some topics. The
get-together element is missing in online events, and networking is next to
impossible (live chats and &lsquo;virtual after-parties&rsquo; are just poor palliatives.)
In my book, hybrid events are even worse, as live streaming and recordings
discourage live attendance (at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/DevRomagna">DevRomagna meetups</a>, we often get asked
if live streaming or recordings will be available, and the answer is no -
either we do live streaming - and we sometimes do - or we do an in-person
event, but never a mix of the two.)</p>
<p>Going back to Brian&rsquo;s musings, I think I subscribe to them. I am not sure
attendance will ever get back to old numbers. I am afraid a good portion of
those who were regulars became disaffected, and gaining their attention back is
a hard gamble. YouTube and Twitch, I think, are phenomenal competitors, and the
pandemic hiatus threw a ton of fresh new viewers at them.</p>
<p>PS: Coincidentally, we&rsquo;re running an in-person meetup at DevRomagna <a href="https://nicolaiarocci.com/heading-to-go-a-look-at-building-a-video-encoder-meetup/">today</a>.</p>

      <title>My session at WPC 2022</title>

      <description>Yesterday I was at WPC 2022, &amp;ldquo;the most important Italian conference on Microsoft technologies&amp;rdquo;, where I presented a one-hour session titled &amp;ldquo;Reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps with Microsoft Playwright.&amp;rdquo;
Attendance was great and there was a lot of excitement up in the air; it was evident that people were happy to meet and interact in person again. After the forced two years hiatus, it was great to be back at a big on-site conference, let alone speak at it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I was at <a href="https://www.wpc2022.it/">WPC 2022</a>, &ldquo;the most important Italian conference on
Microsoft technologies&rdquo;, where I presented a one-hour session titled &ldquo;Reliable
end-to-end testing for modern web apps with Microsoft Playwright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attendance was great and there was a lot of excitement up in the air; it was
evident that people were happy to meet and interact in person again. After the
forced two years hiatus, it was great to be back at a big on-site conference,
let alone speak at it. I delivered my talk to a packed-full room of nodding,
smiling and questioning attendees, which felt fantastic.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/wpc2022-1.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m satisfied with my delivery, although I managed to screw up a few
things, most notably showing my Twitter password live (that was a funny
moment)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I also forgot to mention a couple of things.</p>
<ul>
<li>I demoed CLI usage on Bash, but the kind people working on Playwright also
provide full Powershell support; the website defaults to Powershell for their
demo scripts;</li>
<li>I never mentioned the obvious: as you&rsquo;re testing your front-end application
with Playwright, you&rsquo;re actually performing a complete end-to-end test
involving your backend. There is great value in end-to-end testing. Several
times we caught subtle things that weren&rsquo;t a direct front-end issue but more
the result of the interaction with the backend. And yes (thanks to the guy who
asked), your testing environment must support the whole stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>The slide deck contains most of the code and bash commands I demoed live on
stage. It&rsquo;s nothing too original; I reproduced the examples on the official
website with a few variations and additions.






<div id="adobe-dc-view" style="border:0; display:block;padding: 0.6em 0;position:relative;left:50%;transform:translateX(-50%);height: 450px; width: 800px;"></div>
<script src="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/view-sdk/viewer.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
	document.addEventListener("adobe_dc_view_sdk.ready", function(){ 
		var adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({clientId: "", divId: "adobe-dc-view"});
		adobeDCView.previewFile({
                content:{location: {url: "https://nicolaiarocci.com/pdf\/reliable-end-to-end-testing-of-modern-web-apps-with-microsoft-playwright.pdf"}},

		}, {embedMode: "SIZED_CONTAINER", showDownloadPDF: false, showPrintPDF: false});
	});
</script>
</p>
<p>I had fun performing again in front of a real, live crowd. Perhaps the induced
break, unexpected and undesirable for many reasons, did me good.</p>

      <description>If you understand Italian, the recording of my Playwright session at UGIdotNET&amp;rsquo;s WebDay 2022 is now available on YouTube1. Playwright is a phenomenal cross-browser, cross-platform, cross-language, single-API, mobile-friendly front-end testing tool.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to giving the same session in English sooner or later, but I should first win my laziness and start looking for exciting events with open CFPs. If you happen to know one, please let me know.</description>

      <description>About seven years ago, I presented the Eve Framework in a very crowded Python room at FOSDEM 2014 in Brussels. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about FOSDEM, well, you should check it out. Every year thousands of developers who recognize themselves with the free and open-source movement gather in Brussels from all over the world. And I mean thousands of them. According to Wikipedia, since 2011, the meeting hosts about 4,000 visitors every year.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About seven years ago, I presented the Eve Framework in a very crowded Python
room at FOSDEM 2014 in Brussels. If you don&rsquo;t know about FOSDEM, well, you
should check it out. Every year thousands of developers who recognize
themselves with the free and open-source movement gather in Brussels from all
over the world. And I mean thousands of them. According to Wikipedia, since
2011, the meeting hosts about 4,000 visitors every year. It&rsquo;s huge, and it&rsquo;s
a one of its kind.</p>
<p>In 2021, FOSDEM was held online. I already <a href="/upcoming-speaking-engagements-with-ramblings/">mentioned</a> how I miss live events. In
that post, I also wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any conference junkie will tell you that she/he attends for the people first,
and only then for the sessions themselves. At these events, the most exciting
stuff happens in the corridors, usually during breaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that FOSDEM seven years ago, I experienced one of those corridor moments. It
did not really happen in a corridor, however.</p>
<p>I was at the Delirium Cafe one night, with my good friend (and exceptionally
skilled Pythonista) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alessandro-Molina/e/B07F8CTSHW?ref_=dbs_p_ebk_r00_abau_000000">Alessandro Molina</a> at my side. Many other conference
attendees were there, and we were all having fun doing what nerds do when they
gather for a night in the pub. We were sitting at this big round table, me,
Alessandro, and three other guys I did not know yet. We all started chatting,
enjoying ourselves over a few rounds of tasty Belgian beer. In front of me was
sitting this friendly, obviously brilliant (if a little shy) guy from
Switzerland. At some point, I don&rsquo;t remember why, we were talking about PyPy,
and getting technical about it. This guy was giving me a rundown on the
ins-and-outs of PyPy, and well, I was surprised at how profound his knowledge
was. In passing, I said that Alessandro and I knew one guy from the core team,
Antonio Cuni. Then I mentioned the original author of the project, Armin Rigo,
I think complimenting him on that significant achievement. The guy in front of
me nodded and then smiled at me. And then came this weird, jarring moment of
silence. That&rsquo;s when my friend Alessandro nudged me and whispered, &ldquo;Hey man,
that&rsquo;s Armin Rigo sitting there. Right in front of you.&rdquo; We all had a good
laugh. The next round was on me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s small moments like these that make attending (and presenting at)
conferences worth it.</p>
<p>PS. I had all the hints—the brilliant guy from Switzerland who knows PyPy like
the back of his hand. Someone wasn&rsquo;t so smart on that night.</p>

      <description>I am presenting at two different events in February next month. Given the current COVID situation, that is entirely unexpected. In 2020 I only gave four talks, three of which were virtual. I am not holding my breath for 2021. Conferences are going virtual all year-long. Next year too, most likely.
There are some clear advantages in going virtual, but the final result is a net negative. Any conference junkie will tell you that she/he attends for the people first, and only then for the sessions themselves.</description>

negative. Any conference junkie will tell you that she/he attends for the
people first, and only then for the sessions themselves. At these events, the
most exciting stuff happens in the corridors, usually during breaks. A little
story here. You might know that I run a motorcycle club. Well, the very idea of
founding it was actually ignited by a corridor chat, few minutes after
I delivered a session. Replicating this kind of in-person interaction online
is, well, next to impossible.</p>
<p>As a speaker, I miss presenting live. A simple glance at the audience helps me
assess how&rsquo;s going and eventually adjust my talk direction. The Q&amp;A session at
the end? That is often a matter of eye contact and body language. Not to
mention the &ldquo;offline session&rdquo; that follows if your presentation had any degree
of success. With online delivery, that&rsquo;s all lost.</p>
<p>Also, I suspect not many online attendees actually pay due attention, not
compared to the same session presented in-person.  I know that&rsquo;s true for me.
When I&rsquo;m comfortably sitting at my desk, too many things compete for my
attention. Every possible distraction is just one click away. And then there&rsquo;s
the family. And my cat, of course.</p>
<p>Speaking of attendance, I would not be surprised to find that many people who
sign up for the event won&rsquo;t actually show up. Again, I know because it
happens to me all the time.  The commitment I have to put in for attending an
in-person conference is much higher, making it more likely that I will actually
participate.</p>
<p>Organizers, on the other hand, are incredible. They do a fantastic job in
attempting to provide an experience as close as possible to the real one. They
are the true heroes of this kind of event. They always have been, even more so
now that we&rsquo;re forced to go virtual. Remember to always have a word of
gratitude for your fellow organizer. She/he deserves that.</p>
<p>Alright, enough with the rambling. Here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m presenting next month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python REST APIs for Humans</strong> at <a href="https://codegen2021.azurewebsites.net/">CloudGen 2021</a></li>
<li><strong>Introduction to F# and functional languages</strong> at <a href="https://scottishsummit.com/">Scottish Summit 2021</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One significant advantage of virtual conferences is that anybody can take part
no matter where she/he lives on the planet. So, maybe you will fancy join us?</p>

      <title>Sviluppare una RESTful Web API con Python, Flask e MongoDB</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;La scorsa settimana a &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;EuroPython 2012&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; ho tenuto un talk intitolato &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Sviluppare una RESTful Web API con Python, Flask e MongoDB&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. Mi ha fatto piacere riscontrare forte interesse sia per gli aspetti teorici dell’architettura REST che per la loro implementazione pratica con strumenti quali Flask e MongoDB. In entrambe le sessioni inglese e italiana mi sono state rivolte molte domande, sia in occasione delle Q&amp;amp;A plenarie che nei successivi colloqui informali. Parecchi anche i commenti ed i suggerimenti, davvero utili ed apprezzati (a quanto pare non sono l’unico che, forte di un background .NET, ha compiuto o sta per compiere il salto verso Python e il mondo open source).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soprattutto ho rilevato una forte curiosità su MongoDB, un database non-relazionale verso il quale sembra prevalere un atteggiamento  di generale timidezza: “vorrei ma non oso”, insomma. Per quanto riguarda Flask direi che ormai, nel vasto firmamento dei micro web framework, è una stella che brilla di luce propria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Per quanto riguarda Flask direi che ormai, nel vasto firmamento dei micro web framework, è una stella che brilla di luce propria.</p>
<p>Per quanto riguarda le registrazioni video potete andare su YouTube o sulla pagina ufficiale di EuroPython (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->english track<!-- raw HTML omitted --> e <!-- raw HTML omitted -->italian track<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Ammetto di essere più soddisfatto della versione inglese nella quale – complice anche l’esperienza italiana del giorno prima – credo di essere stato più sintetico ed efficace. Qui mi limito a proporvi le slide:</p>
<h2 id="ringraziamenti">Ringraziamenti</h2>
<p>Un immenso grazie ai ragazzi dello staff di EuroPython che veramente hanno fatto di tutto per rendere questa manifestazione un evento straordinario – e ci sono riusciti  (una settimana di talk su cinque tracce parallele, sprint, hands-on, corsi, cibo di ottima qualità e credo oltre 800 partecipanti).</p>
<p>Vi racconto un episodio giusto per darvi l’idea di quanto questi ragazzi, tutti volontari, si diano da fare e ci mettano passione vera. Nella sessione italiana ho ‘sforato’ (capita anche ai migliori, mi dicono!) e così mi son trovato a sorvolare su un certo numero di slide. Ebbene il mio talk manager e il suo assistente mi hanno proposto di loro iniziativa di tenere una sessione pomeridiana straordinaria per consentirmi di portare a termine la mia relazione. Non capita tutti i giorni, credetemi. Per mia fortuna gran parte delle persone che avevano assistito alla sessione mattutina sono poi tornate per quella del pomeriggio, altrimenti sai che figura!</p>
<p>Se siete pythonisti o vorreste diventarlo non perdetevi la prossima edizione di questo evento internazionale che, con tutta probabilità, si terrà di nuovo a Firenze l’anno prossimo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Non sono molto soddisfatto della mia relazione: troppo da dire nel poco tempo a disposizione. Mi auguro di aver comunicato bene almeno un paio di cose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ciò che oggi funziona alla grande domani potrebbe non funzionare affatto. Siate pronti a rimettere in discussione voi stessi e il vostro modello di business in qualunque momento.</li>
<li>Non fatevi ingannare dai fatturati milionari sbandierati ovunque ai quattro venti. Ciò che conta davvero è quel che vi rimane in tasca.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Per una città come Ravenna questo BarCamp è una novità benvenuta e necessaria, come dimostrano gli stessi numeri ottenuti: 170 presenze in sala, 400 spettatori collegati alla diretta streaming, 26 relatori. Complimenti alla CNA per averci creduto accettando una sfida dai risultati non scontati. Grazie di cuore e complimenti vivissimi a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lidia Marongiu<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, che ha organizzato e diretto l’evento con tenacia e grande professionalità.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>EuroPython è la conferenza europea di riferimento per il linguaggio Python. Si terrà anche quest’anno a Firenze, dal 2 al 8 luglio. Sono in programma molti interventi davvero interessanti, cosa che rende ancor più soprendente il fatto che i miei talk siano stati votati così tanto.
Date un’occhiata al sito ufficiale per saperne di più sulla conferenza (in questo momento è ancora possibile approfittare dell’offerta early bird per l’acquisto dei biglietti); maggiori informazioni sui miei interventi tra qualche tempo, quando sarà ufficializzato il calendario dei talk.</description>
