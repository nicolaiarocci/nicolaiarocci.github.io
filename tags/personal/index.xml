<p>I see the light 50 years ago in Molise, a southern region of Italy that also
happens to be the smallest and less known. One year later, my brother joins the
family. Our parents are from a small village in Molise heights. When I am
three, my family moves to Nigeria, following my dad, who is employed in the oil
field. We spend about two years there. The memories from that period are
scavenged from some clips recorded by my dad at the time. A female monkey used
to live in our garden. Our home was part of a walled complex. Two soldiers were
guarding the entrance, night and day. The wall, I remember, was built with
wooden pales, very much like those wild-west forts from the old movies. When we
move back, it is for the North-Eastern part of Italy, in the Ferrara province
first, and then in Ravenna. I guess there&rsquo;s not a lot to say about this decade;
the usual baby-son-of-a-middle-class-emigrant-family routine applies here.</p>
<h3 id="10-20">10-20</h3>
<p>Teenage turmoil. I&rsquo;m an insecure, shy adolescent with way too much imagination
and lots of unreleased energy to handle. The neighbourhood offers a good pack
of friends. I tend to keep most of my super-fancy thoughts to myself. It does
not help that I get strange looks when I try to share them with friends. Midway
into the decade, I find out about computers. Claudio, who&rsquo;s living next door,
has a Sinclair Spectrum ZX. I am fascinated by it. After some little moral
suasion, my dad gets me a Commodore 64, which I immediately nick-name Charlie.
It unlocks a universe of possibilities.</p>
<p>At school, I meet Serena. In 1987, at seventeen, I overcome my shyness, go to
the local computer shop, and ask if they&rsquo;d be interested in sponsoring the
first Bulletin Board System, or BBS, in town. Freddy, the guy at the counter,
replies with a convinced yes. A few weeks later, Lorien BBS is alive and
kicking from the shop&rsquo;s backroom. Around it, a gang of local wanna-be hackers
gathers. Among them is Stefano. I graduate from Ravenna&rsquo;s accounting school
with a computer-programming degree.</p>
<h3 id="20-30">20-30</h3>
<p>I spend one hell of a challenging year in the navy. It&rsquo;s my first experience
away from home, discipline is rigid, and the Gulf War is in full swing. After
three months of training, I am deployed as a signaler on board a navy ship in
the Mediterranean sea. When I get back from the navy and am about to enroll in
the Computer Science course at the University of Bologna, Stefano and Freddy
come up with this weird idea that we could start a software company.
I enthusiastically agree. It&rsquo;s the early 90s, I am 21, and the world is my
oyster. We begin with courses, then pivot to what we were set to do: writing
computer programs and selling them. The original Lorien BBS from the 80s moves
into new offices and becomes Phoenix BBS, a fully-fledged FidoNet node<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>MS-DOS is dominating the market. We bet on Windows 3.1 and start writing
software for it. One week I spend at my desk, hacking code; the next week,
I load my car&rsquo;s trunk with my software and travel around Italy, proposing my
boxes to computer stores. At that time, software was sold on floppy disks,
along with a printed manual, all packaged in cardboard boxes. I remember
resellers asking why in the world we were selling Windows software when
everyone was on MS-DOS. Later on, to leverage our now developed resellers'
network, we begin distributing third-party products, mainly anti-virus
software: McAfee and, later, Norton and others. The Internet appears out of
nowhere, and I don&rsquo;t immediately grasp its innovative potential. I marry
Serena. We live in a house we bought years before, with help from my family and
a 20-year loan.  Besides hacking at computers, my hobbies are hiking and
climbing the Alps.</p>
<h3 id="30-40">30-40</h3>
<p>In 2000 our first son Marco is born. Giulia arrives four years later. Then
comes Anna in 2006. Meanwhile, Serena goes back from teaching to being an
epidemiologist, and then she eventually sets back again into teaching math in
high school. I slow down on hiking and climbing and take on running, even
competitively, and swimming. We sell our home, a townhouse, and move into
a flat with an extra bedroom. In the process, we extinguish the loan. We are
now debt-free, and it feels good. I miss the tiny little garden we had; we
traded it for more indoor space: three kids and all. The company grows; we hire
people. The 2000-2010 decade is a fast-paced one for me. A lot of work. The
Millennium Bug; the advent of the Euro. I write the second installment of our
company&rsquo;s primary software product, an accounting application. By the
mid-2000s, we are selling it all across the country with success.</p>
<p>Software distribution is a bitch, however. It grants high revenues but tiny,
close-to-none profits. Meanwhile, the market has shifted from a network of
myriads of small, independent, local computer shops to big franchises and,
a bit later, malls. Many computer shops are forced to close down or join the
franchise, losing their independence. Also, the software starts selling on the
Internet. While our self-produced accounting application keeps selling well and
for a good profit, third-party software distribution comes to a halt.
Producers, anti-virus houses especially, are now by-passing independent
software distributors like us, making direct deals with franchising chains and
malls. Professional accounting applications are not attractive to malls and
franchises, as they are all about consumers. Our infrastructure, built to
accommodate for high volumes thanks to distribution deals, is now an incumbent.
Struggling to survive, we pivot into selling our software online<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. That&rsquo;s
when the world economic crisis of 2008 hits the streets.</p>
<h3 id="40-50">40-50</h3>
<p>We barely survive, not without scratches and pain. We&rsquo;re essentially back where
we started. Only a handful of us, revenues significantly reduced. Expenses,
however, are also dramatically reduced. In 2012 we are all remote workers. Our
premises (that we own) are rented. Somehow in the process, or maybe because of
the process, I start open-sourcing some of my work<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. That leads to
a surprising and somewhat winding path where I emerge as an open-source author,
conference speaker, consultant, and teacher. Somehow I am awarded the MongoDB
Master and then Microsoft MVP awards. All of this is very rewarding personally
and emotionally and is much needed after all the struggle. The smaller and
agile company structure allows us to keep going. I drop running in favor of
body-weight training (I think it is now called calisthenics). I finally get
myself a motorcycle<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>; I always dreamed of owning one. Kids have grown.
Marco, our first son, is currently studying in France at the university, and
the girls are in their teenage years, doing what teenagers do.</p>
<p>Like I think everyone else, looking back, I often question some choices I made
in my life. Ditching university to co-found a company at 21 was, of course,
fundamental. Another pivotal moment was in the mid-2000s when the crisis hit us
hard. I could have parted ways with my colleagues and attempt new ventures. But
it&rsquo;s all in vain. We&rsquo;re left with what we have. I am proud of many achievements
and don&rsquo;t regret the mistakes. I (we) learned from them, and they also were, to
some extent, the vectors for new opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="next">Next</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to launch the third installment of our main application. We&rsquo;ve been
working hard on it, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see it being used by our beloved
clients. This decade and the next one will see me still hacking and working on
computers. More or less of the same? Possibly. Thankfully, I still love my
profession. I can&rsquo;t wait to see how our kids pursue their path in life. We will
be accompanying them from a distance and when necessary. The world is their
oyster.</p>
