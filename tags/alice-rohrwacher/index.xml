&lt;p&gt;In a beautiful essay published in Waiting for God, Simone Weil reminds us that study serves to develop attention, and almost no matter what is studied, even a mathematical exercise that turns out to be incomprehensible is fine. &amp;ldquo;Without feeling or knowing it,&amp;rdquo; Weil writes, &amp;ldquo;that seemingly sterile and fruitless effort has brought more light into the soul. One day one will find the fruit of it (&amp;hellip;) in any sphere of intelligence, perhaps entirely unrelated to mathematics.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
