      <description>I am speaking about OAuth2 and Open ID Connect with ASP.NET Core 8 at Rome .NET Conference 2024 on March 22 and then, less than a week later, at WebDay 2024 in Milan.
I am always particularly excited when I can present the stuff I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on. Being forced to share as I learn encourages me to go deeper into the topic to reinforce my comprehension and better explain it to the audience—a win-win situation.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am speaking about OAuth2 and Open ID Connect with ASP.NET Core 8 at <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.it">Rome .NET
Conference 2024</a> on March 22 and then, less than a
week later, at <a href="https://www.webdayconf.it">WebDay 2024</a> in Milan.</p>
<p>I am always particularly excited when I can present the stuff I&rsquo;m currently
working on. Being forced to share as I learn encourages me to go deeper into the
topic to reinforce my comprehension and better explain it to the audience—a
win-win situation.</p>
<p>While the Rome conference is free, if you are considering <a href="https://www.webdayconf.it">WebDay in
Milan</a> (you should), feel free to use my speaker
coupon P-SPEAKER10 for a 20% discount.  If you come to any, don&rsquo;t be shy and
come to say Hi!</p>
