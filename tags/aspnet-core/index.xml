      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am speaking about OAuth2 and Open ID Connect with ASP.NET Core 8 at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dotnetconf.it&#34;&gt;Rome .NET
Conference 2024&lt;/a&gt; on March 22 and then, less than a
week later, at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.webdayconf.it&#34;&gt;WebDay 2024&lt;/a&gt; in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always particularly excited when I can present the stuff I&amp;rsquo;m currently
working on. Being forced to share as I learn encourages me to go deeper into the
topic to reinforce my comprehension and better explain it to the audience—a
win-win situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Conference 2024</a> on March 22 and then, less than a

<p>I am always particularly excited when I can present the stuff I&rsquo;m currently
working on. Being forced to share as I learn encourages me to go deeper into the
topic to reinforce my comprehension and better explain it to the audience—a
win-win situation.</p>
<p>While the Rome conference is free, if you are considering <a href="https://www.webdayconf.it">WebDay in
Milan</a> (you should), feel free to use my speaker
