&lt;p&gt;I wrote the Dune series because I had this idea that charismatic leaders ought to come with a warning label on their forehead: &amp;ldquo;May be dangerous to your health.&amp;rdquo; One of the most dangerous presidents we had in this century was John Kennedy because people said &amp;ldquo;Yes Sir Mr. Charismatic Leader what do we do next?&amp;rdquo; and we wound up in Vietnam. And I think probably the most valuable president of this century was Richard Nixon. Because he taught us to distrust government and he did it by example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
