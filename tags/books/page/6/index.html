As the subtitle suggests, the book collects stories of rebel mountaineers of all kinds. Some chose to disobey orders; others built refuges of resistance, outposts of autonomy and laboratories of social innovation.
The collection is rich and varied. We go from the heretics who went with Fra Dolcino to the partisans who stopped the Nazi fascists in the mountains of Cuneo and Belluno, up to the contemporary movements against the high-speed train in the Susa Valley....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2021-06-05 07:05:25 +0100 +0100'>June 5, 2021</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Book Review: Alpi Ribelli: Storie di montagna, resistenza e utopia" href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-alpi-ribelli-storie-di-montagna-resistenza-e-utopia/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Book Review: The Voice of the Sirens.

The Greeks have always known that the word is used to convince and show truth and correctness. But they also know that it has a magical force in it: it can turn into a spell, capable of dominating and dragging the listener’s soul; to bewitch like music and to heal like medicine; but, above all, to deceive and mislead....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2021-05-15 07:05:25 +0100 +0100'>May 15, 2021</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Book Review: The Voice of the Sirens.

He made his worldwide trip on a two-cylinder Douglas motorcycle between July 1932 and December 1933, more or less 90 years ago. On his way from London to the colonial Middle East, Fulton crossed Nazi Germany. Some of the countries and places he passed do not exist anymore. Most have changed dramatically; others, not so much. I suspect, for example, that his adventures in Syria, Afghanistan, or at the Indian-Pakistani borders might have been written today....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2021-05-02 07:05:25 +0100 +0100'>May 2, 2021</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Book Review: One Man Caravan" href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-one-man-caravan/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Book Review: The Silence, A Novel</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>It is Super Bowl Sunday in the year 2022. Five people, dinner, an apartment on the east side of Manhattan. The retired physics professor and her husband and her former student waiting for the couple who will join them from what becomes a dramatic flight from Paris.

It sits right at the intersection of two of my (too many) vicious interests: Jazz music and books.
Since the mid-1970s, almost every jazz musician has owned a copy of the same book. It has a peach-colored cover, a chunky, 1970s-style logo, and a black plastic binding. It’s delightfully homemade-looking—like it was printed by a bunch of teenagers at a Kinkos. And inside is the sheet music for hundreds of common jazz tunes—also known as jazz “standards”—all meticulously notated by hand....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2021-04-08 07:05:25 +0100 +0100'>April 8, 2021</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Real Book (of Jazz)" href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/the-real-book-of-jazz/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Book Review: In the Heart of the Sea, The Tragedy of the Waleship Essex</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>While reading Erebus, The Story of a Ship, my attention was caught by a brief mention of the Whaleship Essex. Being the sucker that I am for exploration and dramatic adventure stories from the early days, I researched it, only to surface with Nathaniel Philbricks’ In The Heart of the Sea in my hands.
In the Heart of the Sea brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2021-04-02 07:05:25 +0100 +0100'>April 2, 2021</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Book Review: In the Heart of the Sea, The Tragedy of the Waleship Essex" href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-in-the-heart-of-the-sea-the-tragedy-of-the-waleship-essex/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Book Review: Materada</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>I am very ignorant about the Istrian Peninsula’s history, a gap I always wanted to fill. After some research, Fulvio Tomizza’s book, Materada, surfaced as a good fit to fill this gap. It’s a semi-biographic historical novel set in the Istria of the author’s youth. Fulvio Tomizza was born in Giurizzani di Materada, Istria, in 1935. He had to go through all the torments caused in that disputed area by Fascism first (forced Italianization, cultural suppression), and then by the Second World War and the terrible events that followed: the Foibe massacres and the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2021-03-19 07:05:25 +0100 CET'>March 19, 2021</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Book Review: Materada" href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-materada/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>You Have to Write As Though Your Parents Are Dead</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>The Literary Hub has a great short interview with Ian McEwan.
What’s the best writing advice you’ve ever received? When I was living in London at the start of my career in the mid-1970s, I became friends with Philip Roth, who took an avuncular interest in my work. Where many others thought my writing was wild and weird, he thought I wasn’t being wild enough. He once came to my apartment and spread the typescript of my first novel (The Cement Garden) over the floor....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2021-03-12 07:05:25 +0100 CET'>March 12, 2021</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to You Have to Write As Though Your Parents Are Dead" href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/you-have-to-write-as-though-your-parents-are-dead/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Book Review: The Library at Night</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>As any other bookworm worth its salt, I digested a generous amount of books on books and the history of libraries. Alberto Manguel’s The Library at Night was last, and that is a pity. It probably arrived just a little too late on my shelves. I wish I found it at the beginning of my reading journey when my enthusiasm for libraries and their contents was pristine.
Manguel’s writing is mesmerizing and capable....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2021-03-06 07:05:25 +0100 CET'>March 6, 2021</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Book Review: The Library at Night" href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-the-library-at-night/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Book Review: We Have Always Lived in the Castle</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>I came back to reading Shirley Jackson almost by coincidence. I had just finished watching The Haunting of Hill House, and, as I always do with stuff that tickles my curiosity, I was doing a little research on it. That’s how I learned that the TV Series is loosely based on a novel by the same name written by… Shirley Jackson.
Still imbued by the TV Series’s atmospheres, now knowing about its connection with Jackson, I was ready for another dive into her literature of psychological suspense and terror....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2021-02-18 07:05:25 +0100 CET'>February 18, 2021</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Book Review: We Have Always Lived in the Castle" href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-we-have-always-lived-in-the-castle/></a></article><footer class=page-footer><nav class=pagination><a class=prev href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/tags/books/page/5/>«&nbsp;Prev&nbsp;
