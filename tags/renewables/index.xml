      <description>At home, we haven’t done anything about it yet: we’re still 100% grid-dependant and old-fashioned, partly because it would be problematic for us as we live in an apartment building and partly because, frankly, it still seems expensive, especially with three kids studying away from home. Also, I want to avoid getting entangled in another project; my mental bandwidth is limited (and I suspect it will only worsen over time.)</description>

<p>But I follow the solar energy topic and stay up to speed, as I want to take action one day. Here are two articles I read just in the last couple of days. In many aspects, they are similar, and both draw very optimistic conclusions: solar will get unfathomably cheap.</p>
