&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to tell the story of electronic music without examining the pioneering beats, grooves, and performance aesthetics of Dusseldorf’s Kraftwerk and its founding member, Florian Schneider. Formed in 1970, the band brought an experimental approach to pop music, resulting in some of the most innovative and commercially successful electronic albums of the mid-1970s into the 1980s: &lt;em&gt;Autobahn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Trans-Europe Express&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Man-Machine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Computer World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florian Schneider Collection is the first auction to feature a comprehensive collection of items from Florian’s personal life and career, providing a tantalizing glimpse at his and Kraftwerk’s often-enigmatic musical processes. The sale features over 450 lots of stage- and studio-played instruments and gear, clothing, artwork and furniture from Florian’s home and studios (as well as from Kraftwerk’s Kling Klang Studio), bicycles, Kraftwerk memorabilia, and Florian’s extensive collection of historic woodwind and brass instruments (flutes, clarinets, oboes, saxophones, horns, tubas, and one-of-a-kind oddities).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>My goodness, <a href="https://www.juliensauctions.com/en/auctions/the-florian-schneider-collection">the items up for auction</a> are all adorable. The idea of them being dispersed fills me with unspeakable sadness, although that doesn&rsquo;t stop me from coveting any one of these pieces. I hope someone will acquire the entire lot and build a museum around it. In Düsseldorf, of course.</p>
