      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Easter, everyone. This morning, I completed the long-overdue move of all
my ripped CDs from my old 2012 MacBook Pro to the new one and, then, to my
iPhone. I&amp;rsquo;m using Doppler on both devices. I like Doppler, a simple yet elegant
MP3 player app with few well-thought-out features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am increasingly convinced that &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/sick-and-tired-of-spotifys-music-consuming-model/&#34;&gt;returning to purchased music is the
way&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to streaming services for so long that I almost forgot the
accomplishment of listening to music I own. This music was so significant when I
first listened to it that it was worth buying and carrying along over the years.
It&amp;rsquo;s tangible, too: it&amp;rsquo;s sitting right next to me, on my hard disk and my phone;
I can look at it and, yes, touch and move it as I please, as I can with my
original CDs. The same goes for the new music I buy on Bandcamp or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I am increasingly convinced that <a href="https://nicolaiarocci.com/sick-and-tired-of-spotifys-music-consuming-model/">returning to purchased music is the
way</a>.
I&rsquo;ve been listening to streaming services for so long that I almost forgot the
accomplishment of listening to music I own. This music was so significant when I
first listened to it that it was worth buying and carrying along over the years.
It&rsquo;s tangible, too: it&rsquo;s sitting right next to me, on my hard disk and my phone;
I can look at it and, yes, touch and move it as I please, as I can with my
original CDs. The same goes for the new music I buy on Bandcamp or elsewhere.</p>
<p><img alt="Music I own is sitting right next to me" loading="lazy" src="/images/music-i-own.png"></p>
<p>I can download music from Spotify, but that&rsquo;s rented music that I cannot move
away from the app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also relevant that a much more significant part of my money goes to the
artists when I purchase their music, and I&rsquo;m glad for that because I&rsquo;m thankful.
I want their business to be healthy and prosperous so that I may enjoy more of
their art in the future.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening to <em>Dance Cadaverous</em> from Wayne Shorter&rsquo;s <em>Speak No Evil</em>, a song
I probably last listened to ten years ago. <em>Speak No Evil</em> is one of the 100 CDs
that, back in the day, I started collecting from <a href="http://jazz100.sffjazz.com/top100.html">The Best Jazz (pre-1980) Ever
Released Digitally</a>. I never completed
that collection. I may resume it now, although future purchases will likely be
just MP3s.</p>

      <title>Sick and tired of Spotify&#39;s music-consuming model</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m growing sick and tired of Spotify&amp;rsquo;s music-consuming model. There are many
compelling and sometimes conflicting reasons, most perfectly outlined in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.raed.dev/posts/goodbye_spotify&#34;&gt;The
day I canceled my Spotify
subscription&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on Raed&amp;rsquo;s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to cherish music, I used to religiously collect, catalog and enjoy
every album on my iPod. I could navigate the endless folders and find that exact
song that I needed for that precise moment. Spotify killed that, I listen to
what it suggests and just accept that it will go away when it decides to rotate
it out. Spotify trained me not to look too hard, to let the flow be, and if that
awesome song is gone or removed, don’t worry, we still have a million more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

compelling and sometimes conflicting reasons, most perfectly outlined in <em><a href="https://blog.raed.dev/posts/goodbye_spotify">The

<blockquote>

<p>And also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main screen is littered with podcasts I don’t care about, nor have I ever
listened to. It keeps pushing playlists that feel generic, bland, more based on
demographics than my years of consistent listening history. And there is nothing
I can do about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t cancel my subscription yet, as I would risk being lynched (we&rsquo;re on the
family plan), so I&rsquo;m experimenting with digital purchases of selected music that
I know I want to keep for the long run and that I deem worth sustaining
directly. The current plan is to buy it on Bandcamp, immediately download it,
and then listen to it, probably on Doppler. I will also drop a quick review on
my website (if it is not exciting enough to share here, it&rsquo;s probably not worth
buying in the first place.) I&rsquo;ve been gathering old-style music sources lately
(I primarily follow music critics and websites I respect and listen to live
stations like <a href="/nts-radio/">NTS</a>, Radio Paradise, and Bandcamp Radio). For the
time being, Spotify will stay and serve as a secondary discovery agent.</p>
<p>Yes, I will spend more on music, and it&rsquo;s okay. I won&rsquo;t buy everything I listen
to anyway; the idea is to only invest in the true gems. In a way, this all looks
like going back to old and brick-and-mortar music shop days but actualized, and
I like it a lot.</p>

      <title>My Music in 2022 according to Spotify</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/my-music-in-2022-according-to-spotify/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 07:05:25 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/my-music-in-2022-according-to-spotify/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wrapped by Spotify, the 2022 edition just landed in my mailbox. This year I
listened to twenty-four different genres. My favorite was Indie Jazz, followed
by Hip Hop, Jazz, Electronica and Rock. I am a little puzzled about that Hip
Hop in second place. In total, I spent 14143 minutes listening to music, 80
percent more than other listeners in Italy did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite track was &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/4v6soAl2R4sJB6Iyt2aiHw?si=5101c8519ddb4a2b&#34;&gt;Fear Of The Dawn&lt;/a&gt; by Jack White, followed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3FoXWHV24HO9rpcwkYa9lF?si=773fe3def78c4423&#34;&gt;The
Beginning&lt;/a&gt; by Native Soul, &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/4HWC8Ymr2TlkTo97ttMiIq?si=10862b9eee7b496c&#34;&gt;Sorcery&lt;/a&gt; by The Toxic Avenger, &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3Uxjvj6TXr742JOFa7qYn6?si=074fa76aa8c64b8b&#34;&gt;Spirals&lt;/a&gt; by
Django Django, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/2LRiyKKJf2RTuFx31DEU6E?si=57c827fd08b2499b&#34;&gt;Boy From Michigan&lt;/a&gt; by John Grant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>My favorite artists have been Max Gazzè (a recent rediscovery-and reappraisal),
Rosalía, Accademia Bizantina, Subsonica and Jack White. Again, color me a
little surprised. I like Max Gazzè, but I&rsquo;d swear I listened to many other
artists for at least the same amount of time, if not (way) more. But what do I
know? One cannot beat the algorithm, right?</p>
<p>My “music personality,” as Spotify calls it, would be that of a “serious
relationship: you carefully select the music and artists you listen to but have
a lot of affection to give. If you like an artist, then it’s serious.” Which I
have to admit is kind of my general attitude, not just toward music. Here&rsquo;s my
top 101 (not a typo) for 2022:</p>

      <title>How I stopped Spotify from draining both my RAM and CPU</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I was browsing my Twitter feed when a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/flaper87/status/1564899493572710400&#34;&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; from my
friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/flaper87&#34;&gt;@flaper87&lt;/a&gt; caught my attention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/flaper87-on-spotifyd.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my &amp;ldquo;comfortably old&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Spotify has been an absolute hog. The
simple act of opening it will require three hundred MBs. That&amp;rsquo;s a remarkable
amount of memory for staying idle and doing nothing useful. Let it play for
a few hours, and have fun glancing at CPU and RAM usage ramping up like there&amp;rsquo;s
no tomorrow. Just for the record, here&amp;rsquo;s Spotify memory usage at launch:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, I was browsing my Twitter feed when a <a href="https://twitter.com/flaper87/status/1564899493572710400">suggestion</a> from my
friend <a href="https://twitter.com/flaper87">@flaper87</a> caught my attention:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/flaper87-on-spotifyd.png"></p>
<p>On my &ldquo;comfortably old&rdquo; MacBook Pro<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, Spotify has been an absolute hog. The
simple act of opening it will require three hundred MBs. That&rsquo;s a remarkable
amount of memory for staying idle and doing nothing useful. Let it play for
a few hours, and have fun glancing at CPU and RAM usage ramping up like there&rsquo;s
no tomorrow. Just for the record, here&rsquo;s Spotify memory usage at launch:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/spotify-memory-usage.png"></p>
<p>So what exactly is <a href="https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd">spotifyd</a>? An open source Spotify client
running as a UNIX daemon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spotifyd streams music just like the official client, but is more lightweight
and supports more platforms. Spotifyd also supports the Spotify Connect
protocol, which makes it show up as a device that can be controlled from the
official clients<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Slow Saturday morning, I decided to give the spotifyd/spotify-tui combo a try.
Setting up spotifyd on a Mac with homebrew is as simple as typing <code>brew install spotifyd</code> and then <code>brew services start spotifyd</code> to let it run as a service,
or one can opt to launch it as a stand-alone with <code>spotifyd --no-daemon</code>.</p>
<p>As I quickly learned, on a Mac, you need to edit the default configuration file
to update a couple of settings, as reported on the wiki. Namely, I had to set
<code>backend = 'portaudio'</code> and <code>volume_controller = 'softvol'</code>. While at it,
I also set <code>use_keyring = true</code> to avoid storing my Spotify password in the
file. Here&rsquo;s my current configuration settings:</p>
<pre><code>[global]
username = &quot;&lt;USERNAME&gt;&quot;
use_keyring = true

# On Linux, set both values to 'alsa'
backend = &quot;portaudio&quot;          
volume_controller = &quot;softvol&quot;  

bitrate = 320
volume_normalisation = true
normalisation_pregain = -10

# If set to true, audio data does NOT get cached.
no_audio_cache = false
cache_path = &quot;&lt;USER_LIBRARY&gt;/Application Support/Spotify/PersistentCache/Storage&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>One minor annoyance that doesn&rsquo;t prevent the server from running as intended
and is only noticeable when I run spotifyd as a stand-alone app is a recurring
and rather obscure &ldquo;No route to host&rdquo; warning message. There&rsquo;s an <a href="https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/issues/1026">open
ticket</a> about it. Other than that, spotifyd has been bliss. Most remarkably,
this is the memory usage after a few hours of non-stop streaming:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/spotifyd-memory-usage.png"></p>
<p>Quite an achievement, considering that we started at 300+ MBs.</p>
<p>I also installed <a href="https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui">spotify-tui</a> in an attempt to use it as a replacement for
the official client. As much as I&rsquo;d love to use it (I love its UI/UX), I can&rsquo;t
say I&rsquo;m happy with it. It sometimes reports a server disconnect when, in fact,
the underlying spotifyd service is running fine (and I can connect and play
with it from the official client). Secondly, it is sluggish sometimes. Further
investigation revealed that the project is <a href="https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/issues/1000">not actively maintained</a>. For
the time being, I&rsquo;m connecting to spotifyd from the official iPhone app. I get
the lightweight service with the added benefit that I don&rsquo;t have to switch
windows when I want to interact with Spotify.</p>
