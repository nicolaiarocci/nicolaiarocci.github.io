      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Marcus Aurielius&amp;rsquo; Meditations and, very appropriately and scaringly, YouTube algorithm thought I would be interested in Marcus Aurelius, the Man Who Solved The Universe. The title is bombastic and misplaced, but the video is well executed and correctly summarizes some of the Emperor-Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s thoughts.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading Marcus Aurielius&rsquo; <em>Meditations</em> and, very appropriately and
scaringly, YouTube algorithm thought I would be interested in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv6W0Nv5ev0">Marcus Aurelius,
the Man Who Solved The Universe</a>.
The title is bombastic and misplaced, but the video is well executed and
correctly summarizes some of the Emperor-Philosopher&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>

      <description>The footage, captured directly by NASA&amp;rsquo;s Mars rovers - Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance - unveils the red planet&amp;rsquo;s intricate details. These rovers, acting as robotic geologists, have traversed varied terrains, from ancient lake beds to towering mountains, uncovering Mars&amp;rsquo; complex geological history.
As viewers enjoy these images, they will notice informal place names assigned by NASA&amp;rsquo;s team, providing context to the Martian features observed. Each rover&amp;rsquo;s unique journey is highlighted, showcasing their contributions to Martian exploration.</description>

      <description>The Guardian&amp;rsquo;s The Winterkeeper: A Lifetime Spent Protecting Yellowstone National Park is a beautiful short documentary I truly enjoyed watching.
A little research on Steven Fuller, the protagonist, allowed me to dig out some promising reading material.</description>

      <title>Intro to Large Language Models (video)</title>

      <description>Andrej Karpathy has a very well-done Intro to Large Language Models video on YouTube. As a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI and with a two-year hiatus working on Tesla Autopilot, Karpathy is an authority in the field. He is also good at explaining hard things.
As a Kahneman reader, I appreciated the Thinking Fast and Slow analogy proposed at about half-length in the video: &amp;ldquo;System 1&amp;rdquo; (fast automatic thinking, rapid decisions) is where we&amp;rsquo;re now; &amp;ldquo;System 2&amp;rdquo; (rational, slow thinking, complex decisions) is LLMs next goal.</description>

video on YouTube. As a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI and with a two-year hiatus working on Tesla
Autopilot, Karpathy is an authority in the field. He is also good at explaining hard things.</p>
<p>As a Kahneman reader, I appreciated the <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> analogy proposed at about half-length in the video:
&ldquo;System 1&rdquo; (fast automatic thinking, rapid decisions) is where we&rsquo;re now; &ldquo;System 2&rdquo; (rational, slow thinking, complex
decisions) is LLMs next goal. Also, I suspect Karpathy&rsquo;s intriguing idea of LLMs as the center of a new &ldquo;operating
system style&rdquo; is not too far off from what will emerge soon. The final segment on AI security and known attack vectors
(jailbreaking, prompt injection, data poisoning) is also super interesting.</p>
<p>On his website, Karpathy also has a promising <a href="https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html">zero-to-hero video series</a>, &ldquo;a
course on building neural networks from scratch, in code.&rdquo;</p>

      <title>Modulations - History of Electronic Music</title>

      <description>I stumbled upon Modulations, a documentary on &amp;ldquo;the evolution of electronic music and its many genres. How the wide range of styles and scenes formed through experimentations on sound formation.&amp;rdquo; This short film (75 minutes) is packed with guest stars of all calibers1, some of them genuinely pivotal to the evolution of electronic music. Indeed, the uninitiated mind gets to know a lot of details and amenities on the first decade or so of electronic music.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I stumbled upon <a href="https://youtu.be/icpDt6aQDww">Modulations</a>, a documentary on &ldquo;the evolution of electronic
music and its many genres. How the wide range of styles and scenes formed
through experimentations on sound formation.&rdquo; This short film (75 minutes) is
packed with guest stars of all calibers<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, some of them genuinely pivotal to the
evolution of electronic music. Indeed, the uninitiated mind gets to know a lot
of details and amenities on the first decade or so of electronic music.</p>
<p>Perhaps it attempts to fit too much information into a tight timeline:
many guests, genres, places. There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack, and, inevitably, a lot is
left out. A series (like the excellent Hip-Hop Evolution recently aired on
Netflix) could better cover all the material. Unfortunately, Modulations was
released in 1998, when such an option wasn&rsquo;t even in the books. And this takes
us to my second qualm with this production: it of course doesn&rsquo;t cover the
recent years, let&rsquo;s say from early 2000s up to today. A second part would be
grand.</p>
