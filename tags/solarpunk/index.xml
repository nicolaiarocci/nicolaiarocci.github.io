      <description>I dig this attempt at a Solarpunk Manifesto.
Solarpunk is a movement in speculative fiction, art, fashion, and activism that seeks to answer and embody the question “what does a sustainable civilization look like, and how can we get there?”
The aesthetics of solarpunk merge the practical with the beautiful, the well-designed with the green and lush, the bright and colorful with the earthy and solid.
Solarpunk can be utopian, just optimistic, or concerned with the struggles en route to a better world , but never dystopian.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Solarpunk can be utopian, just optimistic, or concerned with the struggles en route to a better world ,  but never dystopian. As our world roils with calamity, we need solutions, not only warnings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Solutions to thrive without fossil fuels, to equitably manage real scarcity and share in abundance instead of supporting false scarcity and false abundance, to be kinder to each other and to the planet we share.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Solarpunk is at once a vision of the future, a thoughtful provocation, a way of living and a set of achievable proposals to get there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m too compromised and ahead in age to make it my own. Still, I hope this movement has traction among young people, especially those in my field—optimism and activism instead of denial and despair.</p>
