      <title>On the state of developer conferences</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brian Rinaldi has an insightful post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://remotesynthesis.com/blog/developer-conferences/&#34;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt; about the current state of
developer conferences, where &amp;lsquo;current state&amp;rsquo; means post-COVID pandemic. Brian
is well-positioned to reason about this space as a long-time conference
organizer. I appreciate that he also takes the time to explain how the
developer conference business works. The core of his blog is about
post-pandemic conference attendance, which has plunged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;independent, in-person developer conferences are hurting. Based on my own
observation as well as talks with organizers and sponsors that I have come to
know over the years, the average independent in-person event is still down
30-40% from pre-pandemic attendance levels. And often it seems to require
massive discounts or even giveaways to get to this level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

developer conferences, where &lsquo;current state&rsquo; means post-COVID pandemic. Brian
is well-positioned to reason about this space as a long-time conference
organizer. I appreciate that he also takes the time to explain how the
developer conference business works. The core of his blog is about
post-pandemic conference attendance, which has plunged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>independent, in-person developer conferences are hurting. Based on my own
observation as well as talks with organizers and sponsors that I have come to
know over the years, the average independent in-person event is still down
30-40% from pre-pandemic attendance levels. And often it seems to require
massive discounts or even giveaways to get to this level.</p></blockquote>
<p>And he offers an interesting theory on why that is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My hypothesis is that we’ve bifurcated the audience somewhat. The folks that
were there almost exclusively for the content have decided that they can do
so more cheaply and efficiently online via virtual conferences or recordings.
The folks that went for the networking as a primary driver, on the other
hand, are largely eschewing online events as not fulfilling their needs.
[&hellip;] So ultimately what we are left with is a lower in-person audience and a
lower virtual audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a conference speaker and meetup organizer, I noticed that online events saw
low attendance during the pandemic, and they still do today. When available,
recordings partially compensate, but only in audience terms. The problem is
online events are not conferences. &lsquo;Conference&rsquo; originates from the late Latin
&ldquo;conferentia,&rdquo; itself a derivative of &ldquo;conferre,&rdquo; a synonym for the collation
of &ldquo;bring together&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A conference is a meeting to discuss some topics. The
get-together element is missing in online events, and networking is next to
impossible (live chats and &lsquo;virtual after-parties&rsquo; are just poor palliatives.)
In my book, hybrid events are even worse, as live streaming and recordings
discourage live attendance (at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/DevRomagna">DevRomagna meetups</a>, we often get asked
if live streaming or recordings will be available, and the answer is no -
either we do live streaming - and we sometimes do - or we do an in-person
event, but never a mix of the two.)</p>
<p>Going back to Brian&rsquo;s musings, I think I subscribe to them. I am not sure
attendance will ever get back to old numbers. I am afraid a good portion of
those who were regulars became disaffected, and gaining their attention back is
a hard gamble. YouTube and Twitch, I think, are phenomenal competitors, and the
pandemic hiatus threw a ton of fresh new viewers at them.</p>
<p>PS: Coincidentally, we&rsquo;re running an in-person meetup at DevRomagna <a href="https://nicolaiarocci.com/heading-to-go-a-look-at-building-a-video-encoder-meetup/">today</a>.</p>

      <title>Seven years ago at FOSDEM</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/seven-years-ago-at-fosdem/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About seven years ago, I presented the Eve Framework in a very crowded Python
room at FOSDEM 2014 in Brussels. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about FOSDEM, well, you
should check it out. Every year thousands of developers who recognize
themselves with the free and open-source movement gather in Brussels from all
over the world. And I mean thousands of them. According to Wikipedia, since
2011, the meeting hosts about 4,000 visitors every year. It&amp;rsquo;s huge, and it&amp;rsquo;s
a one of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

room at FOSDEM 2014 in Brussels. If you don&rsquo;t know about FOSDEM, well, you
should check it out. Every year thousands of developers who recognize
themselves with the free and open-source movement gather in Brussels from all
over the world. And I mean thousands of them. According to Wikipedia, since
2011, the meeting hosts about 4,000 visitors every year. It&rsquo;s huge, and it&rsquo;s
a one of its kind.</p>
<p>In 2021, FOSDEM was held online. I already <a href="/upcoming-speaking-engagements-with-ramblings/">mentioned</a> how I miss live events. In
that post, I also wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any conference junkie will tell you that she/he attends for the people first,
and only then for the sessions themselves. At these events, the most exciting
stuff happens in the corridors, usually during breaks.</p></blockquote>
<p>At that FOSDEM seven years ago, I experienced one of those corridor moments. It
did not really happen in a corridor, however.</p>
<p>I was at the Delirium Cafe one night, with my good friend (and exceptionally
skilled Pythonista) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alessandro-Molina/e/B07F8CTSHW?ref_=dbs_p_ebk_r00_abau_000000">Alessandro Molina</a> at my side. Many other conference
attendees were there, and we were all having fun doing what nerds do when they
gather for a night in the pub. We were sitting at this big round table, me,
Alessandro, and three other guys I did not know yet. We all started chatting,
enjoying ourselves over a few rounds of tasty Belgian beer. In front of me was
sitting this friendly, obviously brilliant (if a little shy) guy from
Switzerland. At some point, I don&rsquo;t remember why, we were talking about PyPy,
and getting technical about it. This guy was giving me a rundown on the
ins-and-outs of PyPy, and well, I was surprised at how profound his knowledge
was. In passing, I said that Alessandro and I knew one guy from the core team,
Antonio Cuni. Then I mentioned the original author of the project, Armin Rigo,
I think complimenting him on that significant achievement. The guy in front of
me nodded and then smiled at me. And then came this weird, jarring moment of
silence. That&rsquo;s when my friend Alessandro nudged me and whispered, &ldquo;Hey man,
that&rsquo;s Armin Rigo sitting there. Right in front of you.&rdquo; We all had a good
laugh. The next round was on me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s small moments like these that make attending (and presenting at)
conferences worth it.</p>
<p>PS. I had all the hints—the brilliant guy from Switzerland who knows PyPy like
the back of his hand. Someone wasn&rsquo;t so smart on that night.</p>

      <title>Upcoming speaking engagements, with ramblings</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/upcoming-speaking-engagements-with-ramblings/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am presenting at two different events in February next month. Given the
current COVID situation, that is entirely unexpected. In 2020 I only gave &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/speaking&#34;&gt;four
talks&lt;/a&gt;, three of which were virtual. I am not holding my breath for 2021.
Conferences are going virtual all year-long. Next year too, most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some clear advantages in going virtual, but the final result is a net
negative. Any conference junkie will tell you that she/he attends for the
people first, and only then for the sessions themselves. At these events, the
most exciting stuff happens in the corridors, usually during breaks. A little
story here. You might know that I run a motorcycle club. Well, the very idea of
founding it was actually ignited by a corridor chat, few minutes after
I delivered a session. Replicating this kind of in-person interaction online
is, well, next to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>There are some clear advantages in going virtual, but the final result is a net
negative. Any conference junkie will tell you that she/he attends for the
people first, and only then for the sessions themselves. At these events, the
most exciting stuff happens in the corridors, usually during breaks. A little
story here. You might know that I run a motorcycle club. Well, the very idea of
founding it was actually ignited by a corridor chat, few minutes after
I delivered a session. Replicating this kind of in-person interaction online
is, well, next to impossible.</p>
<p>As a speaker, I miss presenting live. A simple glance at the audience helps me
assess how&rsquo;s going and eventually adjust my talk direction. The Q&amp;A session at
the end? That is often a matter of eye contact and body language. Not to
mention the &ldquo;offline session&rdquo; that follows if your presentation had any degree
of success. With online delivery, that&rsquo;s all lost.</p>
<p>Also, I suspect not many online attendees actually pay due attention, not
compared to the same session presented in-person.  I know that&rsquo;s true for me.
When I&rsquo;m comfortably sitting at my desk, too many things compete for my
attention. Every possible distraction is just one click away. And then there&rsquo;s
the family. And my cat, of course.</p>
<p>Speaking of attendance, I would not be surprised to find that many people who
sign up for the event won&rsquo;t actually show up. Again, I know because it
happens to me all the time.  The commitment I have to put in for attending an
in-person conference is much higher, making it more likely that I will actually
participate.</p>
<p>Organizers, on the other hand, are incredible. They do a fantastic job in
attempting to provide an experience as close as possible to the real one. They
are the true heroes of this kind of event. They always have been, even more so
now that we&rsquo;re forced to go virtual. Remember to always have a word of
gratitude for your fellow organizer. She/he deserves that.</p>
<p>Alright, enough with the rambling. Here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m presenting next month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python REST APIs for Humans</strong> at <a href="https://codegen2021.azurewebsites.net/">CloudGen 2021</a></li>
<li><strong>Introduction to F# and functional languages</strong> at <a href="https://scottishsummit.com/">Scottish Summit 2021</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One significant advantage of virtual conferences is that anybody can take part
no matter where she/he lives on the planet. So, maybe you will fancy join us?</p>
