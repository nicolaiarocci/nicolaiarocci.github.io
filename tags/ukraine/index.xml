      <description>While it has been a very challenging and difficult time for the company, it cannot even remotely be compared with the horrendous situation that the people of Ukraine are facing on a daily basis, caused by the war.

<p>I&rsquo;m using JetBrains products when I&rsquo;m not in (neo)vim. For C#, Rider is
fantastic, and so is PyCharm for Python. The company is incredible, too, as
today&rsquo;s bold move demonstrates. They moved 800 employees, got visas, new
locations and apartments, everything. Huge respect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have been awarded their [Open Source License][2] for many
years, so I&rsquo;m biased, but look, now I&rsquo;m even proud of supporting their products
