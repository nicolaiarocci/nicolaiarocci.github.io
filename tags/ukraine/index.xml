      <description>While it has been a very challenging and difficult time for the company, it cannot even remotely be compared with the horrendous situation that the people of Ukraine are facing on a daily basis, caused by the war. Once again, we condemn this aggression, and have and will continue to stand by the people of Ukraine, including our colleagues and their families. More here.

<p>I&rsquo;m using JetBrains products when I&rsquo;m not in (neo)vim. For C#, Rider is
fantastic, and so is PyCharm for Python. The company is incredible, too, as
today&rsquo;s bold move demonstrates. They moved 800 employees, got visas, new
locations and apartments, everything. Huge respect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have been awarded their <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/#support">Open Source License</a> for many
years, so I&rsquo;m biased, but look, now I&rsquo;m even proud of supporting their products

      <description>What the Ukraine flag signifies. A golden field of grain (Ukraine is the world&amp;rsquo;s 4th largest exporter of barley and corn, and the 5th largest exporter of wheat) beneath clear blue skies. Sky above grain, or freedom above bread (source1.)
The story of Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s flag is rich and controversial. It appears to be true, however, that &amp;ldquo;blue sky over sunflowers&amp;rdquo; forms Ukrainians&amp;rsquo; conception of their flag. [rss]: https://nicolaiarocci.com/index.xml [tw]: http://twitter.</description>
