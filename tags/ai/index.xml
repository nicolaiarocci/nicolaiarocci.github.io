      <description>Molly White&amp;rsquo;s experience using LLMs corresponds more or less with my own, but she is much better at recounting, critiquing, and drawing conclusions than I am.
I find my feelings about AI are actually pretty similar to my feelings about blockchains: they do a poor job of much of what people try to do with them, they can&amp;rsquo;t do the things their creators claim they one day might, and many of the things they are well suited to do may not be altogether that beneficial.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>I find my feelings about AI are actually pretty similar to my feelings about blockchains: <strong>they do a poor job of much of what people try to do with them, they can&rsquo;t do the things their creators claim they one day might, and many of the things they are well suited to do may not be altogether that beneficial</strong>. And while I do think that AI tools are more broadly useful than blockchains, they also come with similarly monstrous costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the reality is that you can&rsquo;t build a hundred-billion-dollar industry around a technology that&rsquo;s kind of useful, mostly in mundane ways, and that boasts perhaps small increases in productivity if and only if the people who use it fully understand its limitations. And you certainly can&rsquo;t justify the kind of exploitation, extraction, and environmental cost that the industry has been mostly getting away with, in part because people have believed their lofty promises of someday changing the world.</p>

      <title>ChatGPT is the perfect Linux assistant</title>

      <description>I spent the day doing remote maintenance on multiple Linux machines via ssh. The revelation is that ChatGPT is the bomb for these tasks: What does that command option do? I am trying to remember. What syntax is to install that peculiar and rarely used package on Debian? I am getting this locale configuration error; what was the fix again? All this stuff is answered much sooner than searching online, no matter the search engine.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent the day doing remote maintenance on multiple Linux machines via ssh. The
revelation is that ChatGPT is the bomb for these tasks: What does that command
option do? I am trying to remember. What syntax is to install that peculiar and
rarely used package on Debian? I am getting this locale configuration error;
what was the fix again? All this stuff is answered much sooner than searching
online, no matter the search engine.</p>
<p>The feeling is having a good, untiring Linux connoisseur (and of all the various
ancillary packages) sitting right next to you, always ready to lend a hand. I
also think, and I&rsquo;m probably wrong (but my experience seems to bear this out so
far), that because these are all simple questions about stuff well carved in
stone, hallucinations are unlikely to occur.</p>
<p>My assistant today was ChatGPT 3.5, which is very old by today&rsquo;s LLM standards.
It is also free to use, which makes it all even more impressive.</p>

      <description>“Coding” was never the source of value, and people shouldn’t get overly attached to it. Problem solving is the core skill. The discipline and precision demanded by traditional programming will remain valuable transferable attributes, but they won’t be a barrier to entry.
&amp;ndash; John Carmack
I&amp;rsquo;d be tempted to call bullshit on this one, but it&amp;rsquo;s coming from Carmack, so hey, let me think about it for a minute (it&amp;rsquo;s not the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve caught him endorsing AI).</description>

      <description>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s OpenAI launch of Sora is, as is always the case with OpenAI, mind-boggling. Marquees Browniee&amp;rsquo;s comment is spot-on, so much so as he&amp;rsquo;s obviously involved in the video-making scene.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think content creators are at risk with Sora, not anytime soon, but, as Marquees repeatedly notes in the video above, just one year ago we thought AI-generated video was a joke.</description>

      <description>Ethan Mollick, one of my few LLM/AI sources, just dropped his first impressions on Gemini Advanced, released today, but which he&amp;rsquo;s been testing for a month in early access.
Let me start with the headline: Gemini Advanced is clearly a GPT-4 class model. The statistics show this, but so does a month of our informal testing. And this is a big deal because OpenAI’s GPT-4 (the paid version of ChatGPT/Microsoft Copilot) has been the dominant AI for well over a year, and no other model has come particularly close.</description>

other model has come particularly close. Prior to Gemini, we only had one
advanced AI model to look at, and it is hard drawing conclusions with a dataset
of one. Now there are two, and we can learn a few things.</p>

      <description>Just Tell Me cleverly leverages ChatGPT to provide short, insightful summaries of YouTube videos.
Have you ever wasted some time watching a youtube video, that got you kind of interested because of the click-baity topic, but in the end turned out to be nothing more BUT click-bait? Or have you ever wanted to just quickly recall what a video that you&amp;rsquo;ve watched some time ago was about? Just Tell Me has you covered!</description>

      <title>Some hints about what the next year of AI looks like</title>

      <description>Professor Ethan Mollick&amp;rsquo;s Signs and Portents analyzes what AI has achieved, what the effects have been so far, and what we might expect in 2024.
To ground ourselves, we can start with two quotes that should inform any estimates about the future. The first is Amara&amp;rsquo;s Law: &amp;ldquo;We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.&amp;rdquo; Social change is slower than technological change.</description>

its adoption (and it is remarkably fast), yet we certainly will see it sooner
than many people think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an insightful read that pairs well with Simon Wilson&rsquo;s <a href="/stuff-we-figured-out-about-ai-in-2023/">2023
round-up</a>. Also, his 30-second fake
video of himself telling things he never told is impressive.</p>

      <description>Simon Wilson, who&amp;rsquo;s recently been my go-to person for all AI-related stuff, has an excellent 2023 AI round-up on his website.
2023 was the breakthrough year for Large Language Models (LLMs). I think it&amp;rsquo;s OK to call these AI—they&amp;rsquo;re the latest and (currently) most &amp;ldquo;interesting development in the academic field of Artificial Intelligence that dates back to the 1950s. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt to round up the highlights in one place!</description>

      <description>I always struggle a bit with I&amp;rsquo;m asked about the &amp;ldquo;hallucination problem&amp;rdquo; in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.
We direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the LLM&amp;rsquo;s hazy recollection of its training documents, most of the time the result goes someplace useful.
It&amp;rsquo;s only when the dreams go into deemed factually incorrect territory that we label it a &amp;ldquo;hallucination&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Andrej Karpathy has a very well-done Intro to Large Language Models video on YouTube. As a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI and with a two-year hiatus working on Tesla Autopilot, Karpathy is an authority in the field. He is also good at explaining hard things.
As a Kahneman reader, I appreciated the Thinking Fast and Slow analogy proposed at about half-length in the video: &amp;ldquo;System 1&amp;rdquo; (fast automatic thinking, rapid decisions) is where we&amp;rsquo;re now; &amp;ldquo;System 2&amp;rdquo; (rational, slow thinking, complex decisions) is LLMs next goal.</description>

<p>As a Kahneman reader, I appreciated the <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> analogy proposed at about half-length in the video:
&ldquo;System 1&rdquo; (fast automatic thinking, rapid decisions) is where we&rsquo;re now; &ldquo;System 2&rdquo; (rational, slow thinking, complex
decisions) is LLMs next goal. Also, I suspect Karpathy&rsquo;s intriguing idea of LLMs as the center of a new &ldquo;operating
system style&rdquo; is not too far off from what will emerge soon. The final segment on AI security and known attack vectors
(jailbreaking, prompt injection, data poisoning) is also super interesting.</p>
<p>On his website, Karpathy also has a promising <a href="https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html">zero-to-hero video series</a>, &ldquo;a
course on building neural networks from scratch, in code.&rdquo;</p>

      <description>Minimalist News is the first LLM project that excites me but in a nervous way. Quoting the About page:
We only publish significant news. To find them we use AI (ChatGPT-4) to read and analyze 1000 top news every day. For each article it estimates magnitude, scale, potential and credibility. Then we combine these estimates to get the final Significance score from 0 to 10. And now the best part: We&amp;rsquo;ll only send you the news scored 6.</description>

Sometimes it&rsquo;s 5 articles, sometimes 2, sometimes 8. And sometimes — none at all. But one thing is constant — you can

</blockquote>
<p>The concept is brilliant and well executed, but I can&rsquo;t help but feel uncomfortable at the notion of an AI curating news
for me. Yet, this is the best use case for LLM/AI I&rsquo;ve seen until now.</p>

<p>However useful these programs may be in some narrow domains (they can be helpful in computer programming, for
example, or in suggesting rhymes for light verse), we know from the science of linguistics and the philosophy of
knowledge that they differ profoundly from how humans reason and use language. These differences place significant
limitations on what these programs can do, encoding them with ineradicable defects.</p>

Last month one of our journalists received an interesting email. A researcher had come across mention of a Guardian article, written by the journalist on a specific subject from a few years before.

<blockquote>
<p>The reporter couldn’t remember writing the specific piece, but the headline certainly sounded like something they
would have written. It was a subject they were identified with and had a record of covering. Worried that there may
have been some mistake at our end, they asked colleagues to go back through our systems to track it down. Despite the
detailed records we keep of all our content, and especially around deletions or legal issues, they could find no trace
of its existence.</p>

      <description>John Carmack, while advising on the advent of AI and its influence on the Software Engineering profession:
Software is just a tool to help accomplish something for people &amp;ndash; many programmers never understood that. Keep your eyes on the delivered value, and don&amp;rsquo;t over-focus on the specifics of the tools.
I have often fallen into the over-focusing trap in my career. The whole thread is well worth reading:

      <title>Chess@home è una Intelligenza Artificiale Distribuita per gli Scacchi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Il progetto &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Chess@home&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; è il vincitore del recente &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Node Knockout&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, ed una volta tanto si tratta di qualcosa di davvero innovativo e intrigante. Obiettivo: la creazione della più potente Intelligenza Artificiale per il gioco degli Scacchi al mondo, generata nientemeno che dai browser attivi sulla rete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L’elaborazione collaborativa distribuita è diventata famosa grazie a progetti come &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;SETI@home&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; e &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Folding@home&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. Semplificando molto potremmo dire che questo tipo di applicazione prevede che un piccolo programma venga installato e fatto girare su decine di migliaia di computer volontari. La capacita elaborativa del progetto è data dalla somma delle elaborazioni individuali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La novità di Chess@Home consiste nell’idea di ricorrere a codice JavaScript che gira nel browser, dunque senza alcuna necessità di client dedicati. Appositi widget presenti nelle pagine dei siti aderenti innestano l’elaborazione sul computer del visitatore, potenzialmente decuplicando il numero di nodi che partecipano all’elaborazione (più visitatori accedono alla stessa pagina contemporaneamente).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>E’ facile intravedere complicazioni etiche ma occorre tenere conto del fatto che il progetto, messo in piedi in sole 48 ore, è nato soprattutto come esperimento per testare il limite delle tecnologie impiegate (Node.JS, MongoDB, JavaScript). Vi consiglio caldamente l’articolo di uno degli ideatori, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sylvain Zimmer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, che descrive genesi e dettagli tecnici del progetto.</p>
<p>Già oggi potete giocare la vostra prima partita a scacchi contro la rete. Il mio cuore di nerd (che in anni ahimè troppo lontani ha fatto girare impunemente il client SETI per mesi e mesi) tifa per voi.</p>
