      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just back from reading the transcript of &lt;a href=&#34;https://frankchimero.com/blog/2025/beyond-the-machine/&#34;&gt;Beyond the Machine&lt;/a&gt;, a thoughtful and insightful talk by Frank Chimero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to figure out how to use generative AI as a designer without feeling like shit. I am fascinated with what it can do, impressed and repulsed by what it makes, and distrustful of its owners. I am deeply ambivalent about it all. The believers demand devotion, the critics demand abstinence, and to see AI as just another technology is to be a heretic twice over.
Today, I’d like to try to open things up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised by how brilliantly Rick Rubin, Brian Eno, Hayao Miyazaki, and Miyazaki&rsquo;s <em>Spirited Away</em> are packed into this talk.</p>

&lt;p&gt;The old timers who built the early web are coding with AI like it&amp;rsquo;s 1995. Think about it: They gave blockchain the sniff test and walked away. Ignored crypto (and yeah, we&amp;rsquo;re not rich now). NFTs got a collective eye roll. But AI? Different story. The same folks who hand-coded HTML while listening to dial-up modems sing are now vibe-coding with the kids. Building things. Breaking things. Giddy about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We Gen X&rsquo;ers have seen enough gold rushes to know the real thing. This one&rsquo;s got all the usual crap—bad actors, inflated claims, VCs throwing money at anything with &ldquo;AI&rdquo; in the pitch deck. Gross behavior all around. Normal for a paradigm shift, but still gross.</p></blockquote>

<p>The people who helped wire up the internet recognize what&rsquo;s happening. When the folks who&rsquo;ve been through every tech cycle since gopher start acting like excited newbies again, that tells you something.</p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s either panicking that AI will replace them or assuming they don’t need to learn anything anymore. Both miss the point entirely. AI amplifies what you already know. If you understand distributed systems, you’ll use AI to build better ones. If you don’t, you’ll use AI to create distributed disasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference? When that AI-generated code breaks in production — and it will — you need to know why. When it doesn’t scale — and it won’t — you need to understand the bottlenecks. When it creates race conditions, memory leaks, or architectural nightmares, GitHub Copilot won’t save you. &lt;strong&gt;Your fundamentals will&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cloudflare to introduce pay-per-crawl for AI bots</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/cloudflare-to-introduce-pay-per-crawl-for-ai-bots/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/cloudflare-to-introduce-pay-per-crawl-for-ai-bots/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest news in tech this week (which isn&amp;rsquo;t over yet) is, without a doubt, that &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pay-per-crawl/&#34;&gt;Cloudflare is about to introduce a pay-per-crawl model for AI bots&lt;/a&gt;—huge in many ways, as let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that approximately 20% of internet traffic is routed through Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many thoughts right now, and it will take some time for them to settle. A good analysis and explanation of why this move is needed and is a good first step can be found in yesterday&amp;rsquo;s article by Dries Buytaert&amp;rsquo;s, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dri.es/the-webs-broken-deal-with-ai-companies&#34;&gt;The Web&amp;rsquo;s Broken Deal with AI Companies&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend everyone read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I have many thoughts right now, and it will take some time for them to settle. A good analysis and explanation of why this move is needed and is a good first step can be found in yesterday&rsquo;s article by Dries Buytaert&rsquo;s, <a href="https://dri.es/the-webs-broken-deal-with-ai-companies">The Web&rsquo;s Broken Deal with AI Companies</a>, which I recommend everyone read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For 25 years, we built the Open Web on an implicit agreement: search engines could index our content because they sent users back to our websites. That model helped sustain blogs, news sites, and even open source projects. AI companies broke that model. They train on our work and answer questions directly in their own interfaces, cutting creators out entirely. Anthropic&rsquo;s crawler reportedly makes 70,000 website requests for every single visitor it sends back. That is extraction, not exchange.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ongoing discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44432385">Hacker News</a> is also worth reading</p>
<p>Side note, I am fascinated by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/402">technical details</a> surrounding the 402 Payment Required response (and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pay-per-crawl/#publisher-controls-and-pricing">Cloudflare&rsquo;s implementation</a>), which was designed explicitly for micro-payment handling but never gained traction, until now.</p>

      <title>AI coding is less fun</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/ai-coding-is-less-fun/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 10:30:51 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/ai-coding-is-less-fun/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing &amp;ldquo;agentic coding&amp;rdquo; for some time, and well, it&amp;rsquo;s weird. On stable, mature technology (in my case, the C#/.NET stack), it is beneficial, as it significantly boosts productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there&amp;rsquo;s a bit, and that&amp;rsquo;s that I&amp;rsquo;m not programming anymore, or very little now, and I love coding. I love entering &amp;ldquo;the zone&amp;rdquo; and solving complex problems, one at a time. It&amp;rsquo;s always been my superpower. Will I still have fun in the future now that I can delegate most tasks to Claude Code?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing &ldquo;agentic coding&rdquo; for some time, and well, it&rsquo;s weird. On stable, mature technology (in my case, the C#/.NET stack), it is beneficial, as it significantly boosts productivity.</p>
<p>But, there&rsquo;s a bit, and that&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;m not programming anymore, or very little now, and I love coding. I love entering &ldquo;the zone&rdquo; and solving complex problems, one at a time. It&rsquo;s always been my superpower. Will I still have fun in the future now that I can delegate most tasks to Claude Code?</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/04/23/the-hidden-cost-of-ai-coding/">The Hidden Cost of AI Coding</a>, Matheus Lima expresses the same concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of that deep immersion where I&rsquo;d craft each function, I&rsquo;m now more like a <em>curator</em>? I describe what I want, evaluate what the AI gives me, tweak the prompts, and iterate. It&rsquo;s efficient, yes. Revolutionary, even. But something essential feels missing — that state of flow where time vanishes and you&rsquo;re completely absorbed in creation. If this becomes the dominant workflow across teams, do we risk an industry full of highly productive yet strangely detached developers?</p></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s no going back; agentic coding is so helpful that it&rsquo;s tough to let go, especially in tiny teams like mine. Matheus suggests we preserve some space in our work where the flow can still happen, and that&rsquo;s probably what I&rsquo;m going to do: on some projects, maybe the open-source ones I maintain, resist the temptation of a <code>claude /init</code> and keep going like the good old times. One can at least try.</p>

&lt;p&gt;As a broke teenager, the web was this strange wonderland where you could access all kinds of copyrighted material using tools developed by fringe individuals/communities: Napster, Kazaa, Torrents, Usenet, etc. These tools (at least in the beginning) weren’t really made for profit, just to subvert the gatekeepers (and yeah, steal their profits).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2030s, intelligence and energy—ideas, and the ability to make ideas happen—are going to become wildly abundant. These two have been the fundamental limiters on human progress for a long time; with abundant intelligence and energy (and good governance), we can theoretically have anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>People won&#39;t use IDEs anymore</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just back from watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/live/6eBSHbLKuN0&#34;&gt;Mastering Claude Code in 30 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;, a talk by Boris Cherny, who, I learned, created Claude Code. I was struck by Boris&amp;rsquo;s reply to one question from the crowd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey, why did you build a CLI tool instead of an IDE?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s a good question. There are two reasons. We started this at Anthropic, where people use a broad range of IDEs. Some people use VS code. Other people use Zed, Xcode, Vim, or Emacs. And it was just hard to build something that works for everyone. And so the terminal is just the common denominator. The second thing is that at Anthropic, we see firsthand how quickly the model is improving. &lt;strong&gt;I think there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that by the end of the year, people won&amp;rsquo;t use IDEs&lt;/strong&gt;. And so, we want to prepare for this future and avoid over-investing in UI and other layers on top. Given the way the models are progressing, it may not be practical to work on them soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s one fascinating bold statement right there. It aligns with a vision I&rsquo;ve had for a while: in a not-too-distant future, people will use LLM UIs (think Claude.ai with plug-and-play MCP support and voice recognition<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> both built in) as their primary interface instead of many different, specialized applications, at least for most use cases.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>One remarkable suggestion from the talk is to use macOS voice dictation instead of typing prompts to Claude Code.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <title>Claude Code first impressions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since yesterday, Claude Code has been included in the Pro subscription we&amp;rsquo;re signed up for. I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to try it for a while, and now nothing was stopping me. Only yesterday (a curious coincidence), I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/ai-changes-everything/&#34;&gt;AI Changes Everything&lt;/a&gt; by Armin Ronacher, which gave me a glimpse of the potential and made my hands itch to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initialization of Claude on the repository surprised me; the analysis (reported in CLAUDE.md) is thorough and reveals a good understanding of the project, including both the code and the general functioning, strategies, techniques, technologies and libraries employed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since yesterday, Claude Code has been included in the Pro subscription we&rsquo;re signed up for. I&rsquo;d been wanting to try it for a while, and now nothing was stopping me. Only yesterday (a curious coincidence), I read <a href="/ai-changes-everything/">AI Changes Everything</a> by Armin Ronacher, which gave me a glimpse of the potential and made my hands itch to try it.</p>
<p>The initialization of Claude on the repository surprised me; the analysis (reported in CLAUDE.md) is thorough and reveals a good understanding of the project, including both the code and the general functioning, strategies, techniques, technologies and libraries employed.</p>
<p>I asked Claude to generate a test suite from scratch, and it did so rather effortlessly (it went back and forth a few times, and it is fascinating following its reasoning and attempts from a distance). Claude added the tests to the existing project, a big no-no for me. I asked it to go back and create a dedicated test project, and it complied, adding the new project to the solution. It took several iterations to achieve a good result. We now have 134 tests that cover 98% of the project&rsquo;s business logic. Upon request, Claude also added code coverage by installing the missing tools.</p>
<p>Once satisfied with the test suite and having committed and pushed (via Claude) the work done, I asked Claude to set up a GitHub Action to run the tests on every push, then to update the existing workflows (container build; deployment to test or production; etc.) so they all run tests first.</p>
<p>In half a day of work, during which I mostly did other things, such as helping a colleague while Claude was chugging away, I achieved what would have taken me a week or even just a few days.</p>
<p>I have very little to complain about in terms of code quality, and where I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied, I informed Claude and the unsatisfying code was quickly and pleasantly refactored. However, some refactoring is better done with Rider because it&rsquo;s faster, doesn&rsquo;t miss anything (like Claude tends to do if there are multiple similar refactorings to be done and they are scattered across various files) and doesn&rsquo;t waste tokens that count toward usage limits (with the Pro subscription, we have access to a lighter tier of Claude Code. You want the Max subscription for unlimited - or higher anyway- ceiling).</p>
<p>One valuable feature is memory. You can have Claude memorize directives. This memory can be local to the repo or global. I instructed Claude to prefer collection expressions and utilize C#&rsquo;s new targeted-type initialization feature, among other things, which were duly noted. I then asked Claude to refactor in light of the new directives, and it did. New code is now produced according to my preferences, and it will be on all my projects.</p>
<p>A thorough code review is always necessary, of course, but wouldn&rsquo;t you do that for any code coming into your project?</p>
<p>Color me impressed so far. Copying and pasting from LLM&rsquo;s web UIs is already a thing of the past. The present is all about agents, and they&rsquo;re just getting started.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the purpose of his article, but I wish Armin had gone into the details of how, why, and when he delegates tasks to Claude Code.</p>

On this occasion, I discovered a new use for ChatGPT and LLMs. ChatGPT and I chatted about the themes, especially the correlations and connections between the three short novels that comprise the volume. It was an alienating and revealing experience. For the first time, I am reasoning about a book with a machine, not a person. Because it knows everything about the text and draws on the shared global knowledge, it can give more satisfaction than most people do (also, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to find someone around with whom I can talk about all the books I read!) Yes, it is wordy and repetitive, but it can stimulate and enrich my analysis&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using LLMs (ChatGPT and Claude) more and more lately, especially for work. The more I use them, the more I understand how to leverage their capabilities. I would have never thought about sharing my reading experiences with ChatGPT before. <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/getting-started-with-ai-good-enough">Ethan Mollick</a> has it right; we should all put at least 10 hours into LLMs before judging them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your goal is simple: spend 10 hours using AI on tasks that actually matter to you. After that, you&rsquo;ll have a natural sense of how AI fits into your work and life. You&rsquo;ll develop an intuition for effective prompting, and you&rsquo;ll better understand AI&rsquo;s potential. Don&rsquo;t aim for perfection - just start somewhere and learn as you go.</p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kara Swisher, a dean in digital and classical journalism, has an interesting article in the New York Magazine. As a witness and protagonist she recounts how in the last 30 years digital has eaten away at traditional media and how today, with the advent of AI, there is a risk of it happening all over again. Above all, she reasons why it is essential for journalists not to surrender their weapons and lawmakers to step in and finally harness an industry that always had free reign and no regulation, as it is considered inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] more and more people across the globe get their news and cues from social media. It has a scary ability to generate anxiety and rage, and it is addictive. Expert after expert I’ve talked to over the years has made the same point — in the new paradigm, engagement equals enragement. This is made worse by the people who run these companies, for whom anticipation of consequences is lacking and whose first instinct is to let it all through the gate, regardless of potential damage or danger. What’s the opposite of the mommy state? Parent-free chaos.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read her article <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/kara-swisher-burn-book-excerpt-silicon-valley-media.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I appreciate how Swisher was an initial proponent of digital advent, so much so that she <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Digital">co-founded All Things Digital</a>. Yet, that didn&rsquo;t prevent her from foreseeing the troubled waters ahead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hiring engineers is about composing teams. The smallest unit of software ownership is not the individual, it’s the team.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever been on a team packed exclusively with staff or principal engineers? It is not fun. That is not a high-functioning team. There is only so much high-level architecture and planning work to go around, there are only so many big decisions that need to be made. These engineers spend most of their time doing work that feels boring and repetitive, so they tend to over-engineer solutions and/or cut corners—sometimes at the same time. They compete for the “fun” stuff and find reasons to pick technical fights with each other. They chronically under-document and under-invest in the work that makes systems simple and tractable.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The best teams are ones where no one is bored, because every single person is working on something that challenges them and pushes their boundaries. The only way you can get this is by having a range of skill levels on the team.</p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Simon Willison has a new article explaining an important and often ununderstood
aspect of LLMs. There&amp;rsquo;s a remarkable difference between chatting with an LLM, as
we users do, and training it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short version: ChatGPT and other similar tools do not directly learn from and
memorize everything that you say to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you start a new chat conversation, you clear the slate. Each
conversation is an entirely new sequence, carried out entirely independently of
previous conversations from both yourself and other users. Understanding this is
key to working effectively with these models. Every time you hit “new chat” you
are effectively wiping the short-term memory of the model, starting again from
scratch. This has a number of important consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Open AI just did</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/what-open-ai-just-did/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 08:41:04 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/what-open-ai-just-did/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open AI just released ChatGPT 4o. The launch demo is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, and yes, it is impressive. They did not launch v5, though, and 4o is only incremental, not exponential, as v4 has been compared to its predecessor. It may mean we&amp;rsquo;re at the end of the &amp;ldquo;exponential growth&amp;rdquo; phase of LLM models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the most critical aspect of this release is not technical, as Ethan Mollick correctly pinpoints in his timely &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/what-openai-did&#34;&gt;What Open AI Did&lt;/a&gt; post:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Open AI just released ChatGPT 4o. The launch demo is available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw">YouTube</a>, and yes, it is impressive. They did not launch v5, though, and 4o is only incremental, not exponential, as v4 has been compared to its predecessor. It may mean we&rsquo;re at the end of the &ldquo;exponential growth&rdquo; phase of LLM models.</p>
<p>However, the most critical aspect of this release is not technical, as Ethan Mollick correctly pinpoints in his timely <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/what-openai-did">What Open AI Did</a> post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Likely the biggest impact of GPT-4o is not technical, but a business decision: soon everyone, whether they are paying or not, will get access to GPT-4o1. I think this is a big deal. When I talk with groups and ask people to raise their hands if they use ChatGPT, almost every hand goes up. When I ask if they used GPT-4, only 5% of hands remain up, at most. GPT-4 is so, so much better than free ChatGPT-3.5, it is like having a PhD student work with you instead of a high school sophomore. But that $20 a month barrier kept many people from understanding how impressive AI can be, and for gaining any benefit from AI. That is no longer true.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then speculates how this change will impact significant areas such as education, work, and global entrepreneurship.</p>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very fast to build something that&amp;rsquo;s 90% of a solution. The problem is that the last 10% of building something is usually the hard part which really matters, and with a black box at the center of the product, it feels much more difficult to me to nail that remaining 10%. Closing that gap with gen AI feels much more fickle to me than a normal engineering problem. It could be that I&amp;rsquo;m unfamiliar with it, but I also wonder if some classes of generative AI based products are just doomed to mediocrity as a result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Molly White&amp;rsquo;s experience with LLMs corresponds more or less with my own, but she is much better at recounting, critiquing, and drawing conclusions than I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find my feelings about AI are actually pretty similar to my feelings about blockchains: &lt;strong&gt;they do a poor job of much of what people try to do with them, they can&amp;rsquo;t do the things their creators claim they one day might, and many of the things they are well suited to do may not be altogether that beneficial&lt;/strong&gt;. And while I do think that AI tools are more broadly useful than blockchains, they also come with similarly monstrous costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Brilliant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the reality is that you can&rsquo;t build a hundred-billion-dollar industry around a technology that&rsquo;s kind of useful, mostly in mundane ways, and that boasts perhaps small increases in productivity if and only if the people who use it fully understand its limitations. And you certainly can&rsquo;t justify the kind of exploitation, extraction, and environmental cost that the industry has been mostly getting away with, in part because people have believed their lofty promises of someday changing the world.</p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent the day doing remote maintenance on multiple Linux machines via ssh. The
revelation is that ChatGPT is the bomb for these tasks: What does that command
option do? I am trying to remember. What syntax is to install that peculiar and
rarely used package on Debian? I am getting this locale configuration error;
what was the fix again? All this stuff is answered much sooner than searching
online, no matter the search engine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The feeling is having a good, untiring Linux connoisseur (and of all the various
ancillary packages) sitting right next to you, always ready to lend a hand. I
also think, and I&rsquo;m probably wrong (but my experience seems to bear this out so
far), that because these are all simple questions about stuff well carved in
stone, hallucinations are unlikely to occur.</p>
<p>My assistant today was ChatGPT 3.5, which is very old by today&rsquo;s LLM standards.
It is also free to use, which makes it all even more impressive.</p>

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think content creators are at risk with Sora, not anytime soon, but, as Marquees repeatedly notes in the video above, just one year ago we thought AI-generated video was a joke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ethan Mollick&#39;s first impressions on Gemini Advanced</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan Mollick, one of my few &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/some-hints-about-what-the-next-year-of-ai-looks-like/&#34;&gt;LLM/AI
sources&lt;/a&gt;, just dropped
his first impressions on Gemini Advanced, released today, but which he&amp;rsquo;s been
testing for a month in early access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start with the headline: Gemini Advanced is clearly a GPT-4 class
model. The statistics show this, but so does a month of our informal testing.
And this is a big deal because OpenAI’s GPT-4 (the paid version of
ChatGPT/Microsoft Copilot) has been the dominant AI for well over a year, and no
other model has come particularly close. Prior to Gemini, we only had one
advanced AI model to look at, and it is hard drawing conclusions with a dataset
of one. Now there are two, and we can learn a few things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

provide short, insightful summaries of YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wasted some time watching a youtube video, that got you kind of
interested because of the click-baity topic, but in the end turned out to be
nothing more BUT click-bait? Or have you ever wanted to just quickly recall what
a video that you&amp;rsquo;ve watched some time ago was about? Just Tell Me has you

      <title>Some hints about what the next year of AI looks like</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Professor Ethan Mollick&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/signs-and-portents&#34;&gt;Signs and
Portents&lt;/a&gt; analyzes what AI
has achieved, what the effects have been so far, and what we might expect in
2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ground ourselves, we can start with two quotes that should inform any
estimates about the future. The first is Amara&amp;rsquo;s Law: &amp;ldquo;We tend to overestimate
the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the
long run.&amp;rdquo; Social change is slower than technological change. We should not
expect to see immediate global effects of AI in a major way, no matter how fast
its adoption (and it is remarkably fast), yet we certainly will see it sooner
than many people think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It&rsquo;s an insightful read that pairs well with Simon Wilson&rsquo;s <a href="/stuff-we-figured-out-about-ai-in-2023/">2023

video of himself telling things he never told is impressive.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Simon Wilson, who&amp;rsquo;s recently been my go-to person for all AI-related stuff, has
an excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/31/ai-in-2023/&#34;&gt;2023 AI
round-up&lt;/a&gt; on his website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 was the breakthrough year for Large Language Models (LLMs). I think it&amp;rsquo;s
OK to call these AI—they&amp;rsquo;re the latest and (currently) most &amp;ldquo;interesting
development in the academic field of Artificial Intelligence that dates back to
the 1950s. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt to round up the highlights in one place!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The links contained within the post are also valuable. You may know Simon&amp;rsquo;s
website if you are interested in LLMs and AI. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, I suggest you start
following him, preferably via his RSS feed like real hackers do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quoting Andrej Karpathy</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always struggle a bit with I&amp;rsquo;m asked about the &amp;ldquo;hallucination problem&amp;rdquo; in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the LLM&amp;rsquo;s hazy recollection of its training documents, most of the time the result goes someplace useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only when the dreams go into deemed factually incorrect territory that we label it a &amp;ldquo;hallucination&amp;rdquo;. It looks like a bug, but it&amp;rsquo;s just the LLM doing what it always does.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andrej Karpathy has a very well-done &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/zjkBMFhNj_g?si=5tJNFaDcK-FBWnWK&#34;&gt;Intro to Large Language Models&lt;/a&gt;
video on YouTube. As a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI and with a two-year hiatus working on Tesla
Autopilot, Karpathy is an authority in the field. He is also good at explaining hard things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Kahneman reader, I appreciated the &lt;em&gt;Thinking Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt; analogy proposed at about half-length in the video:
&amp;ldquo;System 1&amp;rdquo; (fast automatic thinking, rapid decisions) is where we&amp;rsquo;re now; &amp;ldquo;System 2&amp;rdquo; (rational, slow thinking, complex
decisions) is LLMs next goal. Also, I suspect Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s intriguing idea of LLMs as the center of a new &amp;ldquo;operating
system style&amp;rdquo; is not too far off from what will emerge soon. The final segment on AI security and known attack vectors
(jailbreaking, prompt injection, data poisoning) is also super interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newsminimalist.com&#34;&gt;Minimalist News&lt;/a&gt; is the first LLM project that excites me but in a nervous way. Quoting the About page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only publish significant news. To find them we use AI (ChatGPT-4) to read and analyze 1000 top news every day. For
each article it estimates magnitude, scale, potential and credibility. Then we combine these estimates to get the
final Significance score from 0 to 10. And now the best part: We&amp;rsquo;ll only send you the news scored 6.5 or higher.
Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s 5 articles, sometimes 2, sometimes 8. And sometimes — none at all. But one thing is constant — you can
be sure that you haven&amp;rsquo;t missed anything important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The concept is brilliant and well executed, but I can&rsquo;t help but feel uncomfortable at the notion of an AI curating news
for me. Yet, this is the best use case for LLM/AI I&rsquo;ve seen until now.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Noam Chomsky&amp;rsquo;s essays are always worth reading, no matter the topic he decides to address, because, well, frankly, he&amp;rsquo;s
one of the brightest and most well-informed minds of our time. His criticism of OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT makes no exception. It
does an excellent job of explaining how LLMs work, the differences with human reasoning, and why, in his opinion, the
advent of artificial general intelligence is a long way to go, if ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<blockquote>
<p>However useful these programs may be in some narrow domains (they can be helpful in computer programming, for
example, or in suggesting rhymes for light verse), we know from the science of linguistics and the philosophy of
knowledge that they differ profoundly from how humans reason and use language. These differences place significant
limitations on what these programs can do, encoding them with ineradicable defects.</p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Moran, the Guardian’s head of editorial innovation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month one of our journalists received an interesting email. A researcher had come across mention of a Guardian
article, written by the journalist on a specific subject from a few years before. But the piece was proving elusive on
our website and in search. Had the headline perhaps been changed since it was launched? Had it been removed
intentionally from the website because of a problem we’d identified? Or had we been forced to take it down by the
subject of the piece through legal means?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

would have written. It was a subject they were identified with and had a record of covering. Worried that there may
have been some mistake at our end, they asked colleagues to go back through our systems to track it down. Despite the
detailed records we keep of all our content, and especially around deletions or legal issues, they could find no trace
of its existence.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why? Because it had never been written.</p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;John Carmack, while advising on the advent of AI and its influence on the Software Engineering profession:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software is just a tool to help accomplish something for people &amp;ndash; many programmers never understood that. Keep your
eyes on the delivered value, and don&amp;rsquo;t over-focus on the specifics of the tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Chess@home è una Intelligenza Artificiale Distribuita per gli Scacchi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Il progetto &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Chess@home&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; è il vincitore del recente &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Node Knockout&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, ed una volta tanto si tratta di qualcosa di davvero innovativo e intrigante. Obiettivo: la creazione della più potente Intelligenza Artificiale per il gioco degli Scacchi al mondo, generata nientemeno che dai browser attivi sulla rete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L’elaborazione collaborativa distribuita è diventata famosa grazie a progetti come &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;SETI@home&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; e &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Folding@home&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. Semplificando molto potremmo dire che questo tipo di applicazione prevede che un piccolo programma venga installato e fatto girare su decine di migliaia di computer volontari. La capacita elaborativa del progetto è data dalla somma delle elaborazioni individuali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La novità di Chess@Home consiste nell’idea di ricorrere a codice JavaScript che gira nel browser, dunque senza alcuna necessità di client dedicati. Appositi widget presenti nelle pagine dei siti aderenti innestano l’elaborazione sul computer del visitatore, potenzialmente decuplicando il numero di nodi che partecipano all’elaborazione (più visitatori accedono alla stessa pagina contemporaneamente).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>E’ facile intravedere complicazioni etiche ma occorre tenere conto del fatto che il progetto, messo in piedi in sole 48 ore, è nato soprattutto come esperimento per testare il limite delle tecnologie impiegate (Node.JS, MongoDB, JavaScript). Vi consiglio caldamente l’articolo di uno degli ideatori, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sylvain Zimmer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, che descrive genesi e dettagli tecnici del progetto.</p>
<p>Già oggi potete giocare la vostra prima partita a scacchi contro la rete. Il mio cuore di nerd (che in anni ahimè troppo lontani ha fatto girare impunemente il client SETI per mesi e mesi) tifa per voi.</p>
