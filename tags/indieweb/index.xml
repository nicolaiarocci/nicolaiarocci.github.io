      <title>The 20-year indie web cycle, maybe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The History of the Web has an interesting take on the resurgence of blogging and
the indie web that seems to be occurring these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With roots in the world of fashion, there exists a cyclical principle
suggesting that every two decades, previously popular trends “every 20 years or
so the trends that were once popular will begin to be on the forefront again.”
What’s old is new again. However, these recurring trends aren’t just rip-offs.
They are remixed and reinterpreted through the lens of a new generation. We are,
perhaps, in a 20 year resurgence for the indie web and blogging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Bring back self-hosted blogs, reinstall a feed reader, make your feed icon prominent on your blog.  Blogs + Atom/RSS is the best decentralized social media system we&amp;rsquo;ve ever had!  And yes I am saying that as co-author of ActivityPub: self hosted blogs is the best decentralized social networking we&amp;rsquo;ve had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ben Werdmuller has a terrific post up on his website. His &amp;ldquo;tortured&amp;rdquo; analogy of
the web and governments as platforms for people to build upon is fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe strongly in the indieweb principles of distributed ownership,
control, and independence. For me, the important thing is that this is how we
get to a diverse web. A web where everyone can define not just what they
write but how they present is by definition far more expressive, diverse, and
interesting than one where most online content and identities must be
squished into templates created by a handful of companies based on their
financial needs. In other words, the open web is far superior to a medium
controlled by corporations in order to sell ads. The former encourages
expression; the latter encourages consumerist conformity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
