      <description>Ben Werdmuller has a terrific post up on his website. His &amp;ldquo;tortured&amp;rdquo; analogy of the web and governments as platforms for people to build upon is fascinating.
I believe strongly in the indieweb principles of distributed ownership, control, and independence. For me, the important thing is that this is how we get to a diverse web. A web where everyone can define not just what they write but how they present is by definition far more expressive, diverse, and interesting than one where most online content and identities must be squished into templates created by a handful of companies based on their financial needs.</description>

<p>I believe strongly in the indieweb principles of distributed ownership,
control, and independence. For me, the important thing is that this is how we
get to a diverse web. A web where everyone can define not just what they
write but how they present is by definition far more expressive, diverse, and
interesting than one where most online content and identities must be
squished into templates created by a handful of companies based on their
financial needs. In other words, the open web is far superior to a medium
controlled by corporations in order to sell ads. The former encourages
expression; the latter encourages consumerist conformity.</p>
