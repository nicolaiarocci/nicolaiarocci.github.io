      <description>Today I learned about ShellCheck, a static analysis tool for shell scripts that &amp;ldquo;finds bugs in your scripts&amp;rdquo;. It can and should be run on the command line, but an online version is also available. It catches most style and syntax errors and has plenty of options, like ignoring specific errors and warnings, which is helpful in CI scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bash-Oneliner: a collection of terminal tricks for Linux</title>

      <description>Bash-Oneliner is an excellent resource for Bash/Linux users. Most of the &amp;ldquo;tricks&amp;rdquo; are well-known, but there is always something to learn. More importantly, finding them all well organized in one file is rare.
I use the reverse lookup of bash-history (Ctrl+R) daily. Still, only today (thanks to an HN comment on Bash-Onliner) did I learn that it also preserves one&amp;rsquo;s comments, which can be exploited to invoke complex commands quickly:</description>

      <title>How to fix the crontab error `rename: Operation not permitted`</title>

      <description>Today, something unexpected happened while I was working on one of our Linux machines. I issued the crontab -e command to add a cron job to my user&amp;rsquo;s crontab file, modified and saved it, only to the following error:
crontab: installing new crontab crontab: crontabs/&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;: rename: Operation not permitted crontab: edits left in /tmp/crontab.hgmsOH/crontab Puzzled, I checked whether my user permissions were all right, if the disk was full, and several other things.</description>

      <title>How to use bash to recursively search and replace a string in all directory files</title>

      <description>Another achievement I unlocked with the recent website update is the newsletter switch from Substack to a fantastic and independent provider, Buttondown. That required updating all the &amp;ldquo;subscribe to my newsletter&amp;rdquo; links. We&amp;rsquo;re talking 5K posts, all saved as individual files in the same directory. The bash command that did that for me is:
find content/post/*.md -type f -exec \ sed -i .bak &amp;#39;s|https://nicolaiarocci.substack.com|https://buttondown.email/nicolaiarocci|g&amp;#39; {} + It is pretty straightforward. find looks for all markdown files in the content/post/ directory.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another achievement I unlocked with the <a href="/new-website-finally-with-no-analytics/">recent website
update</a> is the newsletter switch from Substack to
a fantastic and independent provider,
<a href="https://buttondown.email/refer/nicolaiarocci">Buttondown</a>. That required
updating all the &ldquo;subscribe to my newsletter&rdquo; links. We&rsquo;re talking 5K posts, all
saved as individual files in the same directory. The bash command that did that
for me is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>find content/post/*.md -type f -exec <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">\
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic"></span>    sed -i .bak <span style="font-style:italic">&#39;s|https://nicolaiarocci.substack.com|https://buttondown.email/nicolaiarocci|g&#39;</span> {} +
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It is pretty straightforward. <code>find</code> looks for all markdown files in the
<code>content/post/</code> directory. On each file, <code>sed</code> performs a search-and-replace
action. Notice that I use <code>|</code> instead of the standard <code>/</code> as a separator for the
search-and-replace pattern , and that&rsquo;s because the pattern itself has <code>/</code>s in
the URLs so I need to differentiate. Also, on macOS, the <code>-i</code> parameter requires
a backup file argument (&quot;*.bak&quot;) to make a backup copy before the update. This
argument is unnecessary in newer sed versions and will perform an in-place
update if not provided.</p>
<p>Later, I realized I would be better off if I removed the call to action from my
posts and added it to the footer template instead. That way, I&rsquo;d only have one
place to edit or update it in the future, and my RSS feed (and newsletter
updates,  as they draw from the RSS feed) would be clean of unnecessary spam. In
hindsight, this a move I could&rsquo;ve made many years ago (2010?) when I installed
Hugo for the first time, but hey, better late than never. But how could I delete
calls to action from all my 5K posts? With a variation of the above command, of
course:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>find content/post/*.md -type f -exec sed -i .bak <span style="">&#39;</span>/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It is the same logic as above, but we&rsquo;re replacing the matched string with a
&ldquo;delete all lines till the end of the file&rdquo; pattern this time. I must admit that
this one was trickier to pull off and required a discrete amount of trial and
error.</p>

      <title>rsync with a different user</title>

      <description>Today I learned how to rsync with a user different than the one connected to the remote. Why would one want to do such a thing? The data I need to download from that server is owned by &amp;lsquo;backup,&amp;rsquo; a different, service-only user. I wanted to avoid going the change-permissions slippery route and allow my user direct access to the data.
Looking at the rsync documentation, I learned about the nifty --rsync-path=PROGRAM option:</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I learned how to rsync with a user different than the one connected to the remote. Why would one want to do such a
thing? The data I need to download from that server is owned by &lsquo;backup,&rsquo; a different, service-only user. I wanted to
avoid going the change-permissions slippery route and allow my user direct access to the data.</p>
<p>Looking at the rsync documentation, I learned about the nifty <code>--rsync-path=PROGRAM</code> <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1#opt--rsync-path">option</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use this to specify what program is to be run on the remote machine to start-up rsync. Often used when rsync is not in
the default remote-shell&rsquo;s path (e.g. &ndash;rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The example caught my attention. I could perhaps leverage this option to perform a user switch before executing rsync
(now performed on the remote machine). As further research confirmed, it <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/546296">can be done</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>rsync --rsync-path &#39;sudo -u backup rsync&#39; -a --delete host:source destination
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It didn&rsquo;t work immediately because my user was not a sudoer, but that was an easy fix:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>cat &gt; /etc/sudoers.d/myuser &lt;&lt; EOF
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>myuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/rsync
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>EOF
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you can see, not only must the user be a sudoer, but it also needs to be able to sudo with no password. One last
minor issue was that &lsquo;backup&rsquo;, being a service user, had no shell access. That was another easy fix:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo usermod -s /bin/bash backup
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now my rsync-with-a-different-user command works like a charm. I do have some mild security concerns, though. My user is
a sudoer (can only sudo rsync, though<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), and &lsquo;backup&rsquo; now has shell access. As password logins are turned off, and
SSH keys-only access is allowed to the machine (and I&rsquo;m the only person holding those keys), everything&rsquo;s still
reasonably safe. Are there better ways? Please let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sebastian on Mastodon for <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@DarkMetatron@rollenspiel.social/110939139075153024">pointing out</a> that I should limit the sudoer to just rsync itself. I updated the post accordingly. By the way, this is why I love posting TILs in public.
