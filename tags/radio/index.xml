I&amp;rsquo;m certainly a latecomer, but NTS Radio is the bomb. I have not opened Spotify (whose algorithm I find dull and repetitive) in the last week, not even once.</description>

<p>NTS Radio is a family of like-minded and passionate individuals, dedicated to
supporting exciting music and culture through online radio and events. NTS
uncovers the best of the musical past, celebrates the present and cultivates the

<p>I&rsquo;m certainly a latecomer, but <a href="https://www.nts.live">NTS Radio</a> is the bomb. I
have not opened Spotify (whose algorithm I find dull and repetitive) in the last
week, not even once. I go straight to NTS to find the best and most diverse
music from all genres, played by DJs and independent radio stations worldwide.
Absolute banger.</p>
