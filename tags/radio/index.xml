&lt;p&gt;NTS Radio is a family of like-minded and passionate individuals, dedicated to
supporting exciting music and culture through online radio and events. NTS
uncovers the best of the musical past, celebrates the present and cultivates the
future of the underground music scene, and prides itself on being open-minded
and experimental. &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTS_Radio&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m certainly a latecomer, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nts.live&#34;&gt;NTS Radio&lt;/a&gt; is the bomb. I
have not opened Spotify (whose algorithm I find dull and repetitive) in the last
week, not even once. I go straight to NTS to find the best and most diverse
music from all genres, played by DJs and independent radio stations worldwide.
Absolute banger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
