      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior engineering practitioners from major technology companies gathered for a
multi-day retreat to confront the questions that matter most as AI transforms software
development. The discussions covered more than twenty topics across breakout
sessions, but the most significant insights didn’t emerge from one single session. Instead,
they surfaced at various intersections; we found that the same concerns kept appearing
in different conversations, framed by different people solving different problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This publication synthesizes those cross-cutting themes, organized around the patterns
that senior leaders need to understand and act on now. The retreat did not produce a
single, unified vision of the future, but instead produced something more useful: a map of
the fault lines where current practices are breaking and new ones are forming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
