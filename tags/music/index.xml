      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2001, The Cure released Greatest Hits, the compilation with which they ended their contract with Fiction Records. The first edition of the anthology was accompanied by Acoustic Hits, an acoustic reinterpretation of the band&amp;rsquo;s hits, including Boys Don&amp;rsquo;t Cry, Friday I&amp;rsquo;m in Love, A Forest, Just Like Heaven, Lullaby, and Lovesong, one of the simplest and greatest love songs of all time (just listen to the bass line). The bonus disc was not reissued &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/release/10171635-The-Cure-Acoustic-Hits&#34;&gt;until 2017&lt;/a&gt; and has only recently landed on streaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Acoustic Hits has undeservedly remained under the radar, or at least it has for me. I only recently discovered it thanks to YouTube<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, where many of its beautiful sessions are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+cure+acoustic+sessions">available</a> and of excellent quality.</p>
<p>True to form, I bought the album, and for the past few days, as I ride out this fourth goddam iteration of COVID, it&rsquo;s been on heavy rotation.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Calibro 35&amp;rsquo;s Exploration, their latest album that I have just purchased, supremely fits and redefines the instrumental jazz-funk genre, adding a firm pinch of &amp;ldquo;vintage futurism,&amp;rdquo; as they call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were born with our heads facing forward and our eyes looking backward toward the future and the past. We have always struggled more with the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review that makes them justice and includes a concise yet well-done listening guide is on &lt;a href=&#34;https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/calibro-35-exploration-album-review/&#34;&gt;Far Out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kuma Fo by Les Amazones D&#39;Afrique</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/kuma-fo-by-les-amazones-dafrique/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the historic Dahomey Amazons and founded by three of the biggest powerhouses in African music, Mamani Keïta, Mariam Doumbia, and Oumou Sangare, Les Amazones d&amp;rsquo;Afrique have been using their voices to advocate for women&amp;rsquo;s rights since their 2017 debut. The group has never shied away from mashing up tradition and technology. Still, on Musow Dance, with the endlessly inventive production of Jacknife Lee, they lean heavily into an almost entirely electronic sound, turning up the energy several notches with booming 808s, dramatic synth slides, and bursts of vintage disco. But none of these additions ever overshadow the true soul of the music, instead amplifying the already formidable voices of Les Amazones d&amp;rsquo;Afrique&amp;rsquo;s ever-evolving lineup (&lt;a href=&#34;https://daily.bandcamp.com/best-of-2024/the-best-albums-of-2024-g-m&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><a href="https://lesamazonesdafrique.bandcamp.com/album/musow-danse">Musow Dance</a> is a stunning release, and Kuma Fo is just the perfect leading track. Every component is on point, finely dispensed and precisely interleaved: voices, sound, beat, you name it. The producer, after all, is Jacknife Lee (R.E.M., Taylor Swift, U2.)</p>

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3384140492/size=small/bgcol=333333/linkcol=0f91ff/track=1250735316/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://lesamazonesdafrique.bandcamp.com/album/musow-danse">Musow Danse by Les Amazones d&#39;Afrique</a></iframe>

<p>Then, there are the lyrics with their meaninful message. While they all sing in their native language (the four members are from different African countries), I could dig out the English translation from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHeC03169e4">official video</a>, which is equally good and powerful.</p>
<p>She preserves life, gives the first breath<br>
She preserves life, gives the first breath<br>
Woman oh, oh woman<br>
She gives the first breath</p>
<p>Chorus:<br>
Whatever they say<br>
Whatever women have to say<br>
Is worth listening to<br>
Life is hard, I fight with courage, let me be<br>
Whatever they say<br>
Whatever women have to say<br>
Is worth listening to<br>
You know, my life is mine, so give me space</p>
<p>The world was created by a woman<br>
Mika mika mika mika mika<br>
She preserves life<br>
Mika mika mika mika mika</p>
<p>You wonder how we’re gona make it?<br>
We decided to gather our strength and fight<br>
Whatever it costs<br>
You wonder how we’ll make it?</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>You light up life<br>
You light up life<br>
To educate a woman is to educate a village<br>
To educate a girl is to educate the world<br>
Get up, get up, get up<br>
Regain your feminine strength<br>
Woman, woman, woman, get up, get up<br>
Regain your feminine strength</p>
<p>I travelled to the North<br>
People from the North told me<br>
That women have dignity<br>
I travelled to the West<br>
People from the West told me<br>
That women have dignity</p>
<p>I belong to myself, I’m free to do what I like<br>
I will not accept what others want me to be<br>
I belong to myself, I’m free to do what I like<br>
I will never accept it anymore</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>Whatever they say<br>
Whatever women have to say<br>
Is worth listening to<br>
I will not be driven like a car<br>
Woman, woman, woman</p>
<p>You give hope<br>
You give hope<br>
You give hope<br>
You give life<br>
To educate a woman is to educate a village<br>
To educate a girl is to educate the world</p>

      <title>Hidden Tracks: Domodossola – Weissmies</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/hidden-tracks-domodossola-weissmies/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:01:15 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have become increasingly interested in sound. Of the short films I shoot while &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/tags/hiking&#34;&gt;hiking&lt;/a&gt;, for example, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that I&amp;rsquo;m primarily interested in their sounds. Footsteps on the ground, birds singing, wind rustling through leaves, things like that. During my &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/a-motorcycle-trip-across-europe/&#34;&gt;motorcycle ride across Europe&lt;/a&gt;, I caught myself recording a walk with the Memo app on my iPhone. Listening to it allows me to reconstruct a sharp and surprisingly clear memory of that early morning, just out of the tent at Shelsley Walsh. My interest in sounds is not new; I&amp;rsquo;ve written about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/what-i-listen-to-while-programming/&#34;&gt;Field Recordings podcast&lt;/a&gt; for example, but lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve become more aware of the importance of sound memory. During my daily early morning walk, I happen to listen to audiobooks or podcasts with the AirPods Pro, but there is always a lot of friction; I have to force myself into putting them on and, usually, after half an hour or so it is a great relief to take them off and listen to the world around me again (the jury is still out on whether I should leave my AirPods at home or not.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I have become increasingly interested in sound. Of the short films I shoot while <a href="/tags/hiking">hiking</a>, for example, I&rsquo;ve noticed that I&rsquo;m primarily interested in their sounds. Footsteps on the ground, birds singing, wind rustling through leaves, things like that. During my <a href="/a-motorcycle-trip-across-europe/">motorcycle ride across Europe</a>, I caught myself recording a walk with the Memo app on my iPhone. Listening to it allows me to reconstruct a sharp and surprisingly clear memory of that early morning, just out of the tent at Shelsley Walsh. My interest in sounds is not new; I&rsquo;ve written about the <a href="https://nicolaiarocci.com/what-i-listen-to-while-programming/">Field Recordings podcast</a> for example, but lately, I&rsquo;ve become more aware of the importance of sound memory.

<p>The other day, I read on about <a href="https://www.juliansartorius.com">Julian Sartorius</a> (drummer, percussionist, and artist) latest work, <a href="https://juliansartorius.bandcamp.com/album/hidden-tracks-domodossola-weissmies">Hidden Tracks: Domodossola—Weissmies</a>. He took a five-day hike from Domodossola, Italy (272 meters above the sea) to Switzerland&rsquo;s Weissmies summit (4017 mt). He took his drumsticks and a recorder with him, and as he went by, he recorded many sounds, natural and not, and, most importantly, played his sticks on many different surfaces. Quoting <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/julian-sartorius-hidden-tracks-interview">Bandcamp Daily</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every track on Hidden Tracks: Domodossola – Weissmies is named according to that change (i.e., “272m ↗ 500m,” “1500m ↗ 2000m,” etc.). The first few, recorded in Domodossola and its surroundings, are lively—almost symphonic. You can hear passing cars and motorcycles, people talking, dogs barking, church bells tolling. Sartorius plays a hypnotic, techno-like rhythm—sometimes on wooden houses, sometimes with clanks on metal or footsteps on grass. With each subsequent track, the music becomes sparser and quieter. Sounds of nature prevail, as Sartorius plays the rhythm on a surface of a stream, and catches the sound of sheep as they pass through the meadow. It culminates on the mountain’s summit where the only sounds are wind, snow, and ice—and a distant helicopter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Being a hiker myself, I was immediately enthralled by this project. I listened and was not disappointed, so I bought the album to support the author. There&rsquo;s also a short film about the project on <a href="https://youtu.be/xCb3GTRpkXo?si=SrthrnEAVtK7doMl">YouTube</a> that is worth watching.</p>

      <title>Cowboy Bebop</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/cowboy-bebop/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2024 17:03:36 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been following &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop&#34;&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix (the anime, not the spinoff TV series). The opening is a visual and musical marvel; I&amp;rsquo;m enthralled by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EL-D9LrFJd4?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show&amp;rsquo;s soundtrack is a unique blend of jazz (big band hard bop, mainly), blues, and a bit of rock, which I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen before in anime and probably in movies. Even episode titles pay tribute to jazz, blues and rock tracks. We have &amp;ldquo;Valtz for Venus,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Sympathy for the Devil,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;My Funny Valentine,&amp;rdquo; and stuff like that. Adorable. Episodes may appear rambling and superficial at first glance, but they are far from that. They strike a perfect balance between comedy and thought-provoking, often philosophical themes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Last night&rsquo;s episode, &ldquo;Jamming with Edward&rdquo;, struck me as prescient. In 2071, Earth is surrounded by a mountain of scrap metal (mostly decommissioned satellites and wreckage from missiles, probes, and spaceships). Space junk was not a theme in 1998 when the anime was conceived, or was it? And there&rsquo;s this AI, a clear tribute to HAL 9000, left active on a derelict satellite, feeling lonely, misunderstood, and abandoned. It is tremendously timely, resonating with the issues we face today.</p>
<p>I bought the whole Space Cowboy soundtrack. It&rsquo;s the bomb.</p>

      <title>Listening to purchased music is the way</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/listening-to-purchased-music-is-the-way/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Easter, everyone. This morning, I completed the long-overdue move of all
my ripped CDs from my old 2012 MacBook Pro to the new one and, then, to my
iPhone. I&amp;rsquo;m using Doppler on both devices. I like Doppler, a simple yet elegant
MP3 player app with few well-thought-out features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am increasingly convinced that &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/sick-and-tired-of-spotifys-music-consuming-model/&#34;&gt;returning to purchased music is the
way&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to streaming services for so long that I almost forgot the
accomplishment of listening to music I own. This music was so significant when I
first listened to it that it was worth buying and carrying along over the years.
It&amp;rsquo;s tangible, too: it&amp;rsquo;s sitting right next to me, on my hard disk and my phone;
I can look at it and, yes, touch and move it as I please, as I can with my
original CDs. The same goes for the new music I buy on Bandcamp or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

MP3 player app with few well-thought-out features.</p>
<p>I am increasingly convinced that <a href="https://nicolaiarocci.com/sick-and-tired-of-spotifys-music-consuming-model/">returning to purchased music is the
way</a>.
I&rsquo;ve been listening to streaming services for so long that I almost forgot the
accomplishment of listening to music I own. This music was so significant when I
first listened to it that it was worth buying and carrying along over the years.
It&rsquo;s tangible, too: it&rsquo;s sitting right next to me, on my hard disk and my phone;
I can look at it and, yes, touch and move it as I please, as I can with my
original CDs. The same goes for the new music I buy on Bandcamp or elsewhere.</p>
<p><img alt="Music I own is sitting right next to me" loading="lazy" src="/images/music-i-own.png"></p>
<p>I can download music from Spotify, but that&rsquo;s rented music that I cannot move
away from the app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also relevant that a much more significant part of my money goes to the
artists when I purchase their music, and I&rsquo;m glad for that because I&rsquo;m thankful.
I want their business to be healthy and prosperous so that I may enjoy more of
their art in the future.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening to <em>Dance Cadaverous</em> from Wayne Shorter&rsquo;s <em>Speak No Evil</em>, a song
I probably last listened to ten years ago. <em>Speak No Evil</em> is one of the 100 CDs
that, back in the day, I started collecting from <a href="http://jazz100.sffjazz.com/top100.html">The Best Jazz (pre-1980) Ever
Released Digitally</a>. I never completed
that collection. I may resume it now, although future purchases will likely be
just MP3s.</p>

      <title>Dirty Rat by Orbital, with Sleaford Mods [music]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought &lt;a href=&#34;https://orbitalofficial.bandcamp.com/track/dirty-rat-2&#34;&gt;Dirty
Rat&lt;/a&gt;, the absolute
banger from Orbital&amp;rsquo;s 2023 Optical Delusion. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t be anything different,
given that it&amp;rsquo;s a collaboration between the seminal electronic duo that emerged
from the rave era and one of my British favorites, Sleaford Mods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleaford Mods&amp;rsquo; barbed lyrics perfectly augment Orbital&amp;rsquo;s concrete-heavy
digitalism. Mods&amp;rsquo; James Williamson lambasts the people, &amp;ldquo;blaming everyone in the
hospital, everyone at the bottom of the English Channel, and everyone who
doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like a fried animal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Giovanni Ansaldo&amp;rsquo;s convincing review on yesterday&amp;rsquo;s issue of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.internazionale.it/ilmondo&#34;&gt;Il Mondo&lt;/a&gt; podcast, my first Bandcamp
purchase&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is the recently released &lt;a href=&#34;https://deanmcphee.bandcamp.com/album/astral-gold&#34;&gt;Astral
Gold&lt;/a&gt; album by Dean McPhee, a
British guitarist who combines folk with experimental music and jazz using his
telecaster guitar to create endless landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, McPhee&amp;rsquo;s latest album is a journey into outer space. The
album consists of six instrumental pieces, all captivating, enjoyable, and
cohesive; they all serve as each other&amp;rsquo;s natural continuation. Along with the
sound of his guitar, the musician uses tape loops, small percussion sounds, and
a few synthesizers here and there. The result is a hypnotic moonscape
reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The album avoids easy psychedelia and opts for a more meditative approach while
meeting expectations perfectly. Sometimes, it sounds like Brian Eno&rsquo;s early
ambient phase and the more dilated Tangerine Dream. Dean McPhee has created an
otherworldly experience with just a few elements; minimalism is key.</p>

      <title>Sick and tired of Spotify&#39;s music-consuming model</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m growing sick and tired of Spotify&amp;rsquo;s music-consuming model. There are many
compelling and sometimes conflicting reasons, most perfectly outlined in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.raed.dev/posts/goodbye_spotify&#34;&gt;The
day I canceled my Spotify
subscription&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on Raed&amp;rsquo;s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to cherish music, I used to religiously collect, catalog and enjoy
every album on my iPod. I could navigate the endless folders and find that exact
song that I needed for that precise moment. Spotify killed that, I listen to
what it suggests and just accept that it will go away when it decides to rotate
it out. Spotify trained me not to look too hard, to let the flow be, and if that
awesome song is gone or removed, don’t worry, we still have a million more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m growing sick and tired of Spotify&rsquo;s music-consuming model. There are many
compelling and sometimes conflicting reasons, most perfectly outlined in <em><a href="https://blog.raed.dev/posts/goodbye_spotify">The
day I canceled my Spotify
subscription</a></em> on Raed&rsquo;s blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to cherish music, I used to religiously collect, catalog and enjoy
every album on my iPod. I could navigate the endless folders and find that exact
song that I needed for that precise moment. Spotify killed that, I listen to
what it suggests and just accept that it will go away when it decides to rotate
it out. Spotify trained me not to look too hard, to let the flow be, and if that
awesome song is gone or removed, don’t worry, we still have a million more.</p></blockquote>
<p>And also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main screen is littered with podcasts I don’t care about, nor have I ever
listened to. It keeps pushing playlists that feel generic, bland, more based on
demographics than my years of consistent listening history. And there is nothing
I can do about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t cancel my subscription yet, as I would risk being lynched (we&rsquo;re on the
family plan), so I&rsquo;m experimenting with digital purchases of selected music that
I know I want to keep for the long run and that I deem worth sustaining
directly. The current plan is to buy it on Bandcamp, immediately download it,
and then listen to it, probably on Doppler. I will also drop a quick review on
my website (if it is not exciting enough to share here, it&rsquo;s probably not worth
buying in the first place.) I&rsquo;ve been gathering old-style music sources lately
(I primarily follow music critics and websites I respect and listen to live
stations like <a href="/nts-radio/">NTS</a>, Radio Paradise, and Bandcamp Radio). For the
time being, Spotify will stay and serve as a secondary discovery agent.</p>
<p>Yes, I will spend more on music, and it&rsquo;s okay. I won&rsquo;t buy everything I listen
to anyway; the idea is to only invest in the true gems. In a way, this all looks
like going back to old and brick-and-mortar music shop days but actualized, and
I like it a lot.</p>

&lt;p&gt;NTS Radio is a family of like-minded and passionate individuals, dedicated to

uncovers the best of the musical past, celebrates the present and cultivates the

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m certainly a latecomer, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nts.live&#34;&gt;NTS Radio&lt;/a&gt; is the bomb. I
have not opened Spotify (whose algorithm I find dull and repetitive) in the last
week, not even once. I go straight to NTS to find the best and most diverse
music from all genres, played by DJs and independent radio stations worldwide.
Absolute banger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julian Casablancas (The Strokes, The Voidz) says Infinity Repeating is &amp;ldquo;the last Daft Punk song, ever.&amp;rdquo; The song was
recorded in 2013 as a demo and left unpublished until it was included in the 10th-anniversary edition of Random Access
Memories released a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

The video is a highly addictive masterpiece. Digging into the comments on YouTube, I found that someone attempted a

Another thing I learned is that Thomas Bangalter, formerly one-half of Daft Punk, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-04-04/daft-punk-member-thomas-bangalter-terrified-ai&#34;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that his fear of artificial

      <title>My Music in 2022 according to Spotify</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/my-music-in-2022-according-to-spotify/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 07:05:25 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/my-music-in-2022-according-to-spotify/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wrapped by Spotify, the 2022 edition just landed in my mailbox. This year I
listened to twenty-four different genres. My favorite was Indie Jazz, followed
by Hip Hop, Jazz, Electronica and Rock. I am a little puzzled about that Hip
Hop in second place. In total, I spent 14143 minutes listening to music, 80
percent more than other listeners in Italy did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite track was &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/4v6soAl2R4sJB6Iyt2aiHw?si=5101c8519ddb4a2b&#34;&gt;Fear Of The Dawn&lt;/a&gt; by Jack White, followed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3FoXWHV24HO9rpcwkYa9lF?si=773fe3def78c4423&#34;&gt;The
Beginning&lt;/a&gt; by Native Soul, &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/4HWC8Ymr2TlkTo97ttMiIq?si=10862b9eee7b496c&#34;&gt;Sorcery&lt;/a&gt; by The Toxic Avenger, &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3Uxjvj6TXr742JOFa7qYn6?si=074fa76aa8c64b8b&#34;&gt;Spirals&lt;/a&gt; by
Django Django, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/2LRiyKKJf2RTuFx31DEU6E?si=57c827fd08b2499b&#34;&gt;Boy From Michigan&lt;/a&gt; by John Grant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>My favorite artists have been Max Gazzè (a recent rediscovery-and reappraisal),
Rosalía, Accademia Bizantina, Subsonica and Jack White. Again, color me a
little surprised. I like Max Gazzè, but I&rsquo;d swear I listened to many other
artists for at least the same amount of time, if not (way) more. But what do I
know? One cannot beat the algorithm, right?</p>
<p>My “music personality,” as Spotify calls it, would be that of a “serious
relationship: you carefully select the music and artists you listen to but have
a lot of affection to give. If you like an artist, then it’s serious.” Which I
have to admit is kind of my general attitude, not just toward music. Here&rsquo;s my
top 101 (not a typo) for 2022:</p>

&lt;p&gt;Thom [Yorke]&amp;rsquo;s band had a keyboard player — [whom] I think they didn&amp;rsquo;t get on
with because he played his keyboard so loud. And so when I got the chance to
play with them, the first thing I did was make sure my keyboard was turned

and they didn&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d already turned it off.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They made quite a racket, quite a noise. It was all guitars and distortion
— and so I would pretend to play for weeks on end and Thom would say, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t quite hear what you&rsquo;re doing, but I think you&rsquo;re adding a really
interesting texture, because I can tell when you&rsquo;re not playing.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m
thinking, &ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t, because I&rsquo;m really not playing.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;d go home in
the evening and work out how to actually play chords and cautiously over the
next few months, I would start turning this keyboard up. And that&rsquo;s how
I started in with Radiohead.</p></blockquote>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I stumbled upon <a href="https://youtu.be/icpDt6aQDww">Modulations</a>, a documentary on &ldquo;the evolution of electronic

packed with guest stars of all calibers<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, some of them genuinely pivotal to the
evolution of electronic music. Indeed, the uninitiated mind gets to know a lot
of details and amenities on the first decade or so of electronic music.</p>
<p>Perhaps it attempts to fit too much information into a tight timeline:
many guests, genres, places. There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack, and, inevitably, a lot is
left out. A series (like the excellent Hip-Hop Evolution recently aired on
Netflix) could better cover all the material. Unfortunately, Modulations was
released in 1998, when such an option wasn&rsquo;t even in the books. And this takes
us to my second qualm with this production: it of course doesn&rsquo;t cover the
recent years, let&rsquo;s say from early 2000s up to today. A second part would be
grand.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we&amp;rsquo;re releasing a major project on which we&amp;rsquo;ve been working non-stop
for two and a half years. No matter how many years in the trenches, release day
always makes me a bit nervous. Experience does help. I know there will be
problems, and we will solve them. Some customers will complain, and those will
be the most vocal. The vast majority of them will appreciate the effort, enjoy
the features, and stay silent. That&amp;rsquo;s how it works. We&amp;rsquo;ll do just fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>As you can imagine, it&rsquo;s a working weekend for me. While hacking in the early
morning, I listened to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1WjnPw3PbQJOsEpEgJsz5f?si=53a83f9c31484310">The Mildlife Very Fantastic Playlist</a> when a curious
tune caught my attention<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I glanced over to Spotify, and my eyes fell on
the most appropriate CD cover for launch day ever.</p>

      <title>Is Old Music Killing New Music?</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/is-old-music-killing-new-music/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a hunch that old songs were taking over music streaming platforms—but
even I was shocked when I saw the most recent numbers. According to MRC Data,
old songs now represent 70% of the US music market. Those who make a living
from new music—especially that endangered species known as the working
musician—have to look at these figures with fear and trembling. But the news
gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t say I can relate as my kids of ages 21, 18, and 16 do their best to
stay clear from the music I like, but anyways, Ted Gioia&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/is-old-music-killing-new-music&#34;&gt;latest piece&lt;/a&gt; on
recent music trends is super-interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Book Review: Language of the Spirit, An Introduction to Classical Music</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-language-of-the-spirit-an-introduction-to-classical-music/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this introduction to classical music, Jan Swafford explains the different
musical periods and their differences. Each period has its introductory
chapter, followed by chapters dedicated to the most influential composers of
the era. The choice is comprehensive and well cared for, with the most relevant
names well-investigated both in biography and works. For each composer,
Swafford also offers some listening suggestions. Biographies thicken as we get
into the contemporary era. Here, some are limited to just a page or two while
others, obviously those of the author&amp;rsquo;s preferred composers, remain as thorough
as those of the older periods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this introduction to classical music, Jan Swafford explains the different
musical periods and their differences. Each period has its introductory
chapter, followed by chapters dedicated to the most influential composers of
the era. The choice is comprehensive and well cared for, with the most relevant
names well-investigated both in biography and works. For each composer,
Swafford also offers some listening suggestions. Biographies thicken as we get
into the contemporary era. Here, some are limited to just a page or two while
others, obviously those of the author&rsquo;s preferred composers, remain as thorough
as those of the older periods.</p>
<p>The introductory chapters to various musical eras (Baroque, Classical,
Romantic, Modernism and beyond) were, for me, the most interesting ones. In
these chapters, Swafford explains the changes in society, technology and taste
that influenced the musical styles, themselves a revelation of the spirit of
the time. In this sense, Language of the Spirit is not just a classical music
book but also a historical essay, often sharp and full of intriguing
information on the periods crossed.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s effort in using simple language, understandable even to the
uninitiated, is evident, and the goal is well achieved, for the most part.
Sometimes, however, albeit very rarely, it goes into the technical, where
someone like me, who lacks a solid background, might struggle.</p>
<p><img alt="Language of the Spirit: An Introduction to Classical Music" loading="lazy" src="/images/language-of-the-spirit.jpg#right">
The recommended listenings are excellent. For every single one, I wanted to
stop reading and listen to it. That&rsquo;s the approach recommended by the author,
but I never managed, too eager to finish the chapter. I then tried to make
a Spotify playlist out of them, failing miserably because of my pedantry;
I only wanted the suggested executions, often missing on Spotify.</p>
<p>Language of the Spirit is a recommended introduction to classical music and its
history. It allows the reader to collect a phenomenal list of composers and
their works while, at the same time, delving into the momentous changes faced
by (mainly European) society over the last few centuries.</p>

      <title>Five Minutes to Make You Love Classical Music</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/five-minutes-to-make-you-love-classical-music/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 07:05:25 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I already &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/what-i-listen-to-while-programming&#34;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; what background music (or sounds) I like when I am
coding. In that list, I included classical music. I know classical is not
exactly a favorite. Not in my field, at least. I suspect the vast majority of
people disregard it in advance, not really knowing what they&amp;rsquo;re missing out on,
just because, well, you know, it&amp;rsquo;s dinosaurs stuff. If you are among them, you
should reconsider and repent your sins. But have no worries, and rejoice, for
I am here to save your soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I already <a href="/what-i-listen-to-while-programming">mentioned</a> what background music (or sounds) I like when I am
coding. In that list, I included classical music. I know classical is not
exactly a favorite. Not in my field, at least. I suspect the vast majority of
people disregard it in advance, not really knowing what they&rsquo;re missing out on,
just because, well, you know, it&rsquo;s dinosaurs stuff. If you are among them, you
should reconsider and repent your sins. But have no worries, and rejoice, for

<p>Zachary Woolfe, The New York Times&rsquo;s classical music editor, has been working
on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/arts/music/five-minutes-love-music.html">Five Minutes To Make You Love Classical Music</a>. This remarkable project aims
at &ldquo;hooking readers on classical music, five minutes at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once a month online, about 15 musicians, pop-culture figures and Times
writers and editors each select the piece they would play for a friend tied
to a theme, be it an instrument, composer, genre or voice type. The series
aims to make classical music accessible to readers as a Top 40 track [&hellip;].
You don&rsquo;t need to know the difference between a cadenza and a concerto. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
about pure pleasure and exploration.&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/insider/five-minutes-love-classical-music.html">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>I find this project interesting for many reasons, the main one being the
variance of choices and themes. Picks are often excellent and not obvious. This
is, I think, because of the wide range of people involved with the selections.
You may have Yo-Yo Ma suggest a Concerto for the Cello installment, and then
Mark Hamill or Condoleeza Rice propose a listening for the Mozart segment. How
about Cecilia Bartoli for Baroque music?</p>
<p>Mind you, I am not a classical music expert. I just try and like to listen to
good music, regardless of the genre. I am probably the ideal target for
a project like this, which explains why I keep coming back. My favorite?
Probably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/arts/music/five-minutes-classical-music-cello.html">Five Minutes That Will Make You Love the Cello</a>, although I am
having a hard time accepting that Bach&rsquo;s Suite No. 1 is not included in the
selection (Suite No. 5 is, though.)</p>
<p>Official NYT playlists for the series are available on Spotify and, I presume,
other platforms. I know because I wasted a couple hours building my own before
finding out.</p>

      <title>What I listen to while programming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What music do you listen to while programming?&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For me, it&amp;rsquo;s usually jazz,
classical, electronic, lots of it, or nothing. There are some specialized
websites and podcasts I sometimes recur to, like [Music for Programming][1].
Several Spotify playlists I dig a lot, [Every Day I&amp;rsquo;m Nerdin&amp;rsquo;][2] being one of
them. What can I say? I am musically omnivore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I recently discovered something different: the [Field Recordings
podcast][3]. &amp;ldquo;A podcast where audio-makers stand silently in fields (or things
that could be broadly interpreted as fields).&amp;rdquo; I am told it was launched last
year, just about when the COVID lockdowns started, by acclaimed UK audio artist
and producer Eleanor McDowall. It&amp;rsquo;s free, updated daily with submissions coming
from all over the world, and holds many treasures. Most episodes are short, I&amp;rsquo;d
say around the 5 minutes mark, with some notable exceptions like [The Sound of
2020][4], &amp;ldquo;A slow weave of some of 2020&amp;rsquo;s Field Recordings in chronological
order&amp;rdquo;. One of my favorites has got to be the &amp;ldquo;[Inside the log burner][5]&amp;rdquo;
episode by Chris Attaway (Devoran, Cornwall, UK, January 2021):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I was prepping a fire in our log burner on a cold, blustery day here in
Devoran, Cornwall and the wind whistling through the vents was really creepy!
So I stuck my Zoom inside and recorded it for a bit. It was like it had its
own little atmosphere and weather inside!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>At my desk churning out code, I hit play, and that stove is instantly
teleported here, right by my side. I can almost feel its warmth. Indeed,
there&rsquo;s something cathartic about listening to these sound fragments from all
over the world.</p>
