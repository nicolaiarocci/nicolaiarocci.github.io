&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m writing, I write. When I&amp;rsquo;m cooking, I cook. When I&amp;rsquo;m talking to someone, I put my phone away. The constant mental juggling that felt necessary before now feels exhausting. There&amp;rsquo;s something meditative about giving your full attention to a single task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Programming isn&#39;t the job</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI can replace most of programming, but programming isn’t the job. Programming is a task. It’s one of many things you do as part of your work. But if you’re a software engineer, your actual job is more than typing code into an editor. The mistake people make is conflating the task with the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like saying calculators replaced accountants. Calculators automated arithmetic, but arithmetic was never the job. The job was understanding financials, advising clients, making judgment calls, etc. The calculator just made accountants faster at the mechanical part. AI is doing something similar for us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If everything is slow-moving around you, it is likely not going to be good. To fully make use of your brain, you need to move as close as possible to the speed of your thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of humankind, and for tens of thousands of years, the idea that humanity includes every individual on the face of the earth has not existed. This designation stops at the border of a tribe or linguistic group, sometimes even at the edge of a village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Paraphrased from Claude Lévi-Strauss, &lt;em&gt;Race and History&lt;/em&gt;, 1952 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://fieldnotesandfootnotes.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/quoting-levi-strauss-on-ethnocentrism-and-barbarism-following-a-brief-rambling-prelude-because-i-cannot-help-myself/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;full quote and context&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess my beloved &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolaiarocci.com/are-we-trek-yet/&#34;&gt;Star Trek future&lt;/a&gt;—post-scarcity, post-conflict, beyond divisions—is still far away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>To hide in the woods</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woods, the jungle, the forest are the boundary between the wild and the civilized, a place of shelter and legendary fears, of hiding and losing oneself. A place of wonder and unease. [..] But what a mythical power lies in this tangle of nature, shadows, and roots, where the unconscious of the world can be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of it [the usefulness of writing] like breathing but for ideas. We do so much reading all day—there should be a natural balance with producing words too. Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand time — which is how you come to befriend life — turn to stone.
Climb a mountain and listen to the conversation between eons encoded in each stripe of rock.
Walk a beach and comb your fingers through the golden dust that was once a mountain.
Pick up a perfect oval pebble and feel its mute assurance that time can grind down even the heaviest boulder, and smooth even the sharpest edge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The old timers who built the early web are coding with AI like it&amp;rsquo;s 1995. Think about it: They gave blockchain the sniff test and walked away. Ignored crypto (and yeah, we&amp;rsquo;re not rich now). NFTs got a collective eye roll. But AI? Different story. The same folks who hand-coded HTML while listening to dial-up modems sing are now vibe-coding with the kids. Building things. Breaking things. Giddy about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We Gen X&rsquo;ers have seen enough gold rushes to know the real thing. This one&rsquo;s got all the usual crap—bad actors, inflated claims, VCs throwing money at anything with &ldquo;AI&rdquo; in the pitch deck. Gross behavior all around. Normal for a paradigm shift, but still gross.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The people who helped wire up the internet recognize what&rsquo;s happening. When the folks who&rsquo;ve been through every tech cycle since gopher start acting like excited newbies again, that tells you something.</p></blockquote>

&lt;p&gt;The lies we tell others
are for survival.&lt;br&gt;
But the lies we tell ourselves&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
those can kill us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Just one good thing</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last year, a mindset shift and approach appeared as a very simple idea: just do one thing, &lt;em&gt;that I want to do today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing can be small or big, easy or labored, fleeting or long. I carve out time to go play drums for two hours, go for a bouldering session, do a shorter 20 minute run, read a page of a book, eat something I’m really excited about, and more. Even on the most difficult day, I can adjust and find the smallest thing that I am excited about and do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is a small niche these days. There isn&amp;rsquo;t much hype around it, nor is there any money to be made because the VC firms are all busy chasing the next big thing, whatever that might be once the AI hype dies off in a year or two. But it is still here, and I like it exactly because it&amp;rsquo;s not the hype technology of the day anymore. It isn&amp;rsquo;t commercialised, algorithmically curated and set up to make some other person rich.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a broke teenager, the web was this strange wonderland where you could access all kinds of copyrighted material using tools developed by fringe individuals/communities: Napster, Kazaa, Torrents, Usenet, etc. These tools (at least in the beginning) weren’t really made for profit, just to subvert the gatekeepers (and yeah, steal their profits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now — in a strange twist of irony — things seem to have flipped:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the 2030s, intelligence and energy—ideas, and the ability to make ideas happen—are going to become wildly abundant. These two have been the fundamental limiters on human progress for a long time; with abundant intelligence and energy (and good governance), we can theoretically have anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The interview is outstanding and worth watching; Cahill is remarkable and a great communicator. In the final part, they&amp;rsquo;re talking about Jannick when Cahill &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KreEMoS0drQ&amp;amp;t=3498s&#34;&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; an incredible Jannick quote:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dave Rupert, reasoning on why he likes books:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books are strange objects. Chapters and chapters of coherent research and lived experiences assembled by people who wanted to put it all down in one place. Edited by actual editors who like editing. Designed— down to the weight of the paper, the typography, and the illustration on the cover— to make the experience of reading it enjoyable. Books are uncanny and impractical objects. A terribly inefficient way to encode information from one brain to another, but an excellent way to tell a story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Capability makes your life simpler. Tolerance, skills, knowledge, and health are always with you, wherever you go. They are assets but they take up no space. They are stored in your body. Some lack capability through no fault of their own, but anyone can increase their capability. It’s an investment that pays dividends every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main issue with social media is that we want them to be everything. We want them to be a place for casual interactions, for discovery, for news, for serious discourse. And that’s a mistake. Because the moment you put a stupid amount of people in one room and you let them do whatever they want the only reasonable outcome you can expect is chaos. Sure, you might get some positive results out of it but you’ll also likely get someone shitting in a corner and someone trying to fuck the power outlet. Because that’s the world we live in. Now sprinkle some nonsense AI on top of it all and Bob’s your uncle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art of not reading is a very important one. It consists in not taking an interest in whatever may be engaging the attention of the general public at any particular time. When some political or ecclesiastical pamphlet, or novel, or poem is making a great commotion, you should remember that he who writes for fools always finds a large public. - A precondition for reading good books is not reading bad ones: for life is short.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always loved libraries. They are a glimpse of the kind of ‘better world’ we all want to live in. That’s because by their very nature they are inclusive and welcoming. Anyone who walks through the doors of a library is reminded, just by inhaling the air of the library, just by being embraced by its atmosphere, to be a kinder and more caring person, and to forget, for a moment, the usual rules of our capitalistic society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I’m out hiking on my weekend hike I often spend much of the experience in contemplation. My thoughts are usually tickling at Warp 10, going everywhere possible at once, but then I ramp it back a bit and I just think about an assortment of topics at any given moment. Out in nature is really a good place for me to get things back into perspective, and I usually feel the better for it when I get back home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When you’re playing a point, it is the most important thing in the world. But
when it’s behind you, it’s behind you&amp;hellip; This mindset is really crucial, because
it frees you to fully commit to the next point… and the next one after that…
with intensity, clarity and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, whatever game you play in life&amp;hellip; sometimes you’re going to
lose. A point, a match, a season, a job&amp;hellip;  it’s a roller coaster, with many ups
and downs.  And it’s natural, when you’re down, to doubt yourself. To feel sorry
for yourself. And by the way, your opponents have self-doubt, too. Don’t ever
forget that.  But negative energy is wasted energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;just writing down notes is all that really matters. Any tool that allows you to compose and save text will do. It is the act of writing, not the act of linking or reading or revisiting, that clarifies thought and leads to insight. The rest is all superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday, I fixed a bug in our legacy application. Once I was done, I turned to my notes to log what I&amp;rsquo;d just done. I was only partially happy with the fix, so I articulated what would have been ideal and why I didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve my goal. Right in the middle of a sentence, the solution surfaced. It was so evident and straightforward! The simple act of writing down the problem led me to the solution. Relieved, I returned to the project and promptly improved my code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very fast to build something that&amp;rsquo;s 90% of a solution. The problem is that the last 10% of building something is usually the hard part which really matters, and with a black box at the center of the product, it feels much more difficult to me to nail that remaining 10%. Closing that gap with gen AI feels much more fickle to me than a normal engineering problem. It could be that I&amp;rsquo;m unfamiliar with it, but I also wonder if some classes of generative AI based products are just doomed to mediocrity as a result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just came across this tweet by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/levie/status/1763356362858430501&#34;&gt;Aaron Levie&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best founders I know — no matter their company’s scale — thrive on doing
customer support directly. There’s literally no better way to understand the
pulse of your customer base, what features to build next, or where systems are
breaking down. It’s always upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It profoundly resonates with me. For context, we&amp;rsquo;ve been a small company in the
market since 1991, making us quite the rare bird (we have seen so many software
companies come and go that it is unbelievable).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

market since 1991, making us quite the rare bird (we have seen so many software
companies come and go that it is unbelievable).</p>
<p>My untiring co-founder, Stefano, still does customer support daily, while I
chime in occasionally when needed. Every Friday at 2.30 pm, our dev and support
teams have a joint call to assess what&rsquo;s going on on the frontline, to get the
pulse and to check if there are new and unexpected issues the customers are
experiencing with our products. This call is complimentary to the live chat that
both teams share daily. This continuous feedback cycle and the resulting quick
release cycle have been the key that allowed us to stay relevant and endure for
such a long time.</p>
<p>Of course, founders doing customer support delays other fundamental
activities, and sometimes that&rsquo;s stressful, but it is worth it.</p>

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a common belief that suffering is necessary for pleasure, or that evil is necessary for good, like the change of the seasons. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those ideas that sounds like wisdom, but when you think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s not actually true. There are some people who are happy all the time, and other people who are miserable all the time. I think suffering and evil are like taking a wrong turn on a journey. Taking a wrong turn sometimes happens, and some good can come of it. But it&amp;rsquo;s never necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Many skeptics about the impact of AI are focused on the flaws that LLMs have today: hallucinations, short context windows, slow answers, and so on. These are legitimate concerns, and, if AI advancement were to stop, they might prove to be huge issues in the utility of AI. But AI is advancing rapidly, and some of these concerns may soon vanish, even if others (like hallucinations) are not completely solved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But AI is advancing rapidly, and some of these concerns may soon vanish, even if others (like hallucinations) are not completely solved.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What that means is that it is fine to be focused on today, building working AI applications and prompts that take into account the limits of present AIs… but there is also a lot of value in building ambitious applications that go past what LLMs can do now. You want to build some applications that almost, but not quite, work. I suspect better LLM “brains” are coming soon, in the form of GPT-5 and Gemini 2.0 and many others. When they do, you can swap them into the almost-but-not-quite-working applications for a fast start. This is similar to the philosophy of the big AI labs, which build ambitious solutions (OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT agents, Google&rsquo;s connections to Gmail) which will benefit when the next version of their core LLMs are released.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So don’t just build for what is possible today, but what is possible in six months, if this pace of change continues. At this point, I think things are unlikely to slow down in the near future, and focusing on where things are heading, rather than where they are, prepares you for a world of continuing change.</p></blockquote>

      <title>Quoting Donald Knuth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Knuth challenged ChatGPT-4 with 20 questions and then submitted the results and his comments to Stephen Wolfram. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/chatGPT20.txt&#34;&gt;whole thing&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating in many ways and worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some remarkable quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course these are extremely impressive responses, sometimes astonishingly so; thus I totally understand why you and
others have been paying attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most immediate impression is the quality of the wordsmithing. It&amp;rsquo;s way better than 99% of copy that people
actually write. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not like a Markov model that uses the most predictable way to continue what&amp;rsquo;s already
been said. On the other hand there are surprising lapses there too, as typical of any large system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/chatGPT20.txt">whole thing</a> is fascinating in many ways and worth reading.</p>
<p>Some remarkable quotes:</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Answer #10 reads as though it&rsquo;s the best answer yet. But it&rsquo;s almost totally wrong!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how the confident tone lends credibility to all of that made-up nonsense. Almost impossible for anybody
without knowledge of the book to believe that those &ldquo;facts&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t authorititative and well researched.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I find it fascinating that novelists galore have written for decades about scenarios that might occur after a
&ldquo;singularity&rdquo; in which superintelligent machines exist. But as far as I know, not a single novelist has realized that
such a singularity would almost surely be preceded by a world in which machines are 0.01% intelligent (say), and in
which millions of real people would be able to interact with them freely at essentially no cost.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I myself shall certainly continue to leave such research to others, and to devote my time to developing concepts that
are authentic and trustworthy. And I hope you do the same.</p></blockquote>

      <title>Quoting Cicero</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to know what happened before one was born is always to be a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this Cicero quote on &lt;em&gt;Lapham&amp;rsquo;s Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/about&#34;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;. A little &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Cicero&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; dug out the supposedly
original version found in &lt;em&gt;Orator Ad M. Brutum&lt;/em&gt; (46 BC). It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child. For what is the worth of human life,
unless it is woven into the life of our ancestors by the records of history?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;John Carmack, while advising on the advent of AI and its influence on the Software Engineering profession:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software is just a tool to help accomplish something for people &amp;ndash; many programmers never understood that. Keep your
eyes on the delivered value, and don&amp;rsquo;t over-focus on the specifics of the tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have often fallen into the over-focusing trap in my career. The whole thread is well worth reading:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quoting the last paragraph from Italo Calvino&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Invisible Cities&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because here’s something else that’s true. In the day-to-day trenches of
adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such
thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what
to worship. And an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of God or
spiritual-type thing to worship-be it J.C. or Allah, be it Yahweh or the
Wiccan mother-goddess or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set of
ethical principles-is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you
alive. If you worship money and things-if they are where you tap real meaning
in life-then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It’s the
truth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel
ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths
before they finally plant you. On one level, we all know this stuff
already-it’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, bromides, epigrams,
parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth
up-front in daily consciousness. Worship power-you will feel weak and afraid,
and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay.
Worship your intellect, being seen as smart-you will end up feeling stupid,
a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on.</p></blockquote>
