      <description>One of my recent discoveries is A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry by Bret Devereaux, an historian who&amp;rsquo;s been posting great content over the years. His Fireside Fridays, for example, provide intriguing musings on varied topics. In this week instalment, professor Devereaux takes on the different applications of blockchain technology as seen from a historian&amp;rsquo;s perspective.
Really, this is less about the technologies themselves and more about the nature of states.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my recent discoveries is <a href="https://acoup.blog/">A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry</a> by
Bret Devereaux, an historian who&rsquo;s been posting great content over the years.
His Fireside Fridays, for example, provide intriguing musings on varied topics.
In this week instalment, professor Devereaux takes on the different
applications of blockchain technology as seen from a historian&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Really, this is less about the technologies themselves and more about the nature of states.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because while I can offer no real opinion as to if any of these new
technologies will succeed in their technical objectives [&hellip;], proponents of
these technologies typically envisage them eventually producing large social
effects, in particular they imagine that blockchain technology will create an
economic and social space outside of the control of the state, traditional
banking institutions or society at large. And here is a space where
a historianâ€™s expertise is valuable and also almost completely lacking among
blockchain enthusiasts.</p>
