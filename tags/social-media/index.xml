      <title>I canceled my Bluesky account</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I deleted my Bluesky account. I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow anyone anyway, and I only used it to repost content from my website. Being almost mainstream now, I found Bluesky to have the same dynamics as other mass-adopted social networks: controversies, lots of ego-hunting, vanity fairs, sterile debates, witticisms, and everything else that doesn&amp;rsquo;t interest me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having left Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/im-leaving-twitter/x/&#34;&gt;a while ago&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook a long time before that, I&amp;rsquo;m left with Mastodon precisely because there are fewer people there, and they are more in my niche; it feels like the pre-mass social media world, like the first Twitter years. Not coincidentally, I&amp;rsquo;m also receiving more feedback on my content than anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Having left Twitter <a href="http://localhost:1313/im-leaving-twitter/x/">a while ago</a> and Facebook a long time before that, I&rsquo;m left with Mastodon precisely because there are fewer people there, and they are more in my niche; it feels like the pre-mass social media world, like the first Twitter years. Not coincidentally, I&rsquo;m also receiving more feedback on my content than anywhere else.</p>
<p>I doubt I&rsquo;ll get back into social networks; they failed me hard. I get all my news from RSS anyway, where I can select the sources, and there&rsquo;s no algorithm dictating the agenda.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that high levels of social media use are connected with an
increased risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression. There appears to be
substantial evidence connecting people’s mental health and their online
habits. Furthermore, many psychologists believe people may be dealing with
psychological effects that are pervasive but not always obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
