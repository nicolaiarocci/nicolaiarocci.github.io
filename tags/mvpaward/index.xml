      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, I was at an outdoor theatre with Serena, watching Anatomy of a Fall (an excellent film). Outdoor theatres are becoming rare, which is a pity, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://maps.app.goo.gl/j7t3SigtkPtKnB22A&#34;&gt;Arena del Sole&lt;/a&gt; is lovely with its strong vintage, 80s vibe. There&amp;rsquo;s little as pleasant as watching a film under the stars with your loved one on a quiet summer evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in the pause, I glanced at my e-mails and discovered I had been again granted the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/mvp/profile/a6892d61-aea0-e511-8114-c4346bac0abc&#34;&gt;Microsoft MVP Award&lt;/a&gt;. It is the ninth consecutive year, and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful and happy the journey continues. At this point, I should put in some extra effort to reach the 10-year milestone next year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I won the Microsoft MVP Award</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just received news that I&amp;rsquo;ve been awarded the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award in the Software
Development category. It is an honor and a pleasure to be renewed for the eighth time. Being a Microsoft MVP means a lot
to me; I remember how intimidated I felt when I met MVPs at various events and how totally out of reach the title seemed
for someone like me. Besides my everyday work, I kept doing the things I loved:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Development category. It is an honor and a pleasure to be renewed for the eighth time. Being a Microsoft MVP means a lot
to me; I remember how intimidated I felt when I met MVPs at various events and how totally out of reach the title seemed
for someone like me. Besides my everyday work, I kept doing the things I loved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on my open-source projects</li>
<li>Present at conferences and local meetups</li>
<li>Write some articles here and there</li>
<li>Blog as usual</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, one day, someone nominated me for the award. I was surprised, baffled and thankful, and I did not expect to pass
the selection process. I was genuinely shocked when I received the first award. Being in the MVP program has been a
happy and rewarding ride, and I&rsquo;m glad the journey continues for another year.</p>

      <title>I&#39;m a Microsoft MVP once again</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am happy and humbled to have been awarded the Microsoft MVP Award for the
seventh consecutive year. July 1, the award assignation day, always comes with
curiosity and a bit of trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a member of the MVP community has been a very positive experience for me,
especially in the years before COVID, when the MVP Summit, the main MVP event,
was held in person in Seattle at the Microsoft HQ. That assembly of experienced
developers from all over the world is an exhilarating experience. Smart guys
and gals from different cultures gather to meet the people responsible for
their daily drivers&amp;rsquo; tools and technologies. There are countless networking
possibilities, both with fellow MVPs and Microsoft personnel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Being a member of the MVP community has been a very positive experience for me,
especially in the years before COVID, when the MVP Summit, the main MVP event,
was held in person in Seattle at the Microsoft HQ. That assembly of experienced
developers from all over the world is an exhilarating experience. Smart guys
and gals from different cultures gather to meet the people responsible for
their daily drivers&rsquo; tools and technologies. There are countless networking
possibilities, both with fellow MVPs and Microsoft personnel.</p>
<p>For the last two years, the Summit has been an online event. I admit I&rsquo;ve had
a hard time following the sessions as work and family tended to get in the way.
The networking was, of course, next to zero. I miss the original MVP Summit. In
the absence of it, even just meeting the Italian MVPs has been a rare
occurrence. Hopefully, things will return to normal this year, although I&rsquo;m
doubtful.</p>
