      <title>How Many Hobbits?</title>

      <description>For those who don’t know me, I’m a demographer. I study population. And my first love in fantasy was, of course, Middle Earth. How many people live in Middle Earth? Being a demographer, I was mainly interested in the data side of things.
Tolkien is frustratingly vague about population. He almost never gives us estimates of settlement sizes, and many of the larger metropolises of Middle Earth (like Pelargir) never actually appear on the page.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Tolkien is frustratingly vague about population. He almost never gives us estimates of settlement sizes, and many of the larger metropolises of Middle Earth (like Pelargir) never actually appear on the page. Sizable armies make frequent appearances, yet because his adventurers almost exclusively traverse the wilds of Middle Earth, we rarely see where those soldiers are coming from.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost every attempt to estimate population in Middle Earth extrapolates from army sizes.  This is no surprise since those are some of the only numbers Tolkien does provide and, furthermore, historically, this is also how ancient populations in the real world are often estimated, so there are some credible rules-of-thumb out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to take a new approach.</p>

      <description>Years ago, I translated an essay by Terry Windling, On Tolkien and Fairie-Stories, from American English to Italian. I remember arguing with the author about her use of periods in quotations. Each quotation would end with a period before the closing mark. I was puzzled. We don&amp;rsquo;t do that in Italy. More importantly, I read many English texts where the period was left outside the quotation itself. She insisted that her style was correct1.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Years ago, I <a href="http://www.endore.it/Arretrati/9/Articoli/SuTolkienELeFiabe.pdf">translated</a> an essay by Terry Windling, <a href="https://accademia.tolkieniana.net/tesi/endicott/tlkefiabeng.html">On Tolkien and
Fairie-Stories</a>, from American English to Italian. I remember arguing with
the author about her use of periods in quotations. Each quotation would end
with a period before the closing mark. I was puzzled. We don&rsquo;t do that in
Italy. More importantly, I read many English texts where the period was left
outside the quotation itself. She insisted that her style was correct<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Today I learn that, in English, there are in fact two different and conflicting
quotation mark punctuation styles: American and British.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are different ways of combining quotation and punctuation marks. In the
American style, you almost always put periods and commas inside the quotation
marks [&hellip;] In the British style, however, you put periods and commas outside
the quotation marks, unless they are part of a complete sentence that is
fully contained between the quotation marks:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/the-american-style-of-quotation-mark-punctuation-makes-no-sense">The American Style of Quotation Mark Punctuation Makes No Sense</a> the
author illustrates the differences between the two styles, then argues that
&ldquo;the British approach makes more sense, so use that one.&rdquo; Whoops.</p>
