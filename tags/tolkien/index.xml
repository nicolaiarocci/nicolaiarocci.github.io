      <title>Isengard in Oxford</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Review of Books on &lt;a href=&#34;https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/isengard-in-oxford/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bovadium Fragments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, JRR Tolkien’s posthumous complete work, which was just recently published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has read Tolkien’s letters will know that he is at his funniest when filled with rage, and The Bovadium Fragments is a work brimming with Tolkien’s fury—specifically, ire over mankind’s obsession with motor vehicles. Tolkien’s anger is expressed through a playful satire told from the perspective of a group of future archaeologists who are studying the titular fragments, which tell of a civilization that asphyxiated itself on its own exhaust fumes. Tolkien’s fictional fragments use the language of ancient myth, reframing modern issues like traffic congestion and parking with a grandeur that highlights their total absurdity. It is Tolkien at his angriest and funniest, making The Bovadium Fragments a minor treasure in his ever-growing catalog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Tolkien’s repulsion toward machines is well documented, with Isengard serving as the in-story metaphor for technology used wrongly. The canonical reference has always been the war machines used in World Wars I and II, which he witnessed with terror on the battlefield. I never imagined that he also glimpsed Isengard in his everyday life, and much closer to home: in the polluted streets of Oxford.</p>

      <title>How Many Hobbits?</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know me, I’m a demographer. I study population. And my first love in fantasy was, of course, Middle Earth. How many people live in Middle Earth? Being a demographer, I was mainly interested in the data side of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tolkien is frustratingly vague about population. He almost never gives us estimates of settlement sizes, and many of the larger metropolises of Middle Earth (like Pelargir) never actually appear on the page. Sizable armies make frequent appearances, yet because his adventurers almost exclusively traverse the wilds of Middle Earth, we rarely see where those soldiers are coming from.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost every attempt to estimate population in Middle Earth extrapolates from army sizes.  This is no surprise since those are some of the only numbers Tolkien does provide and, furthermore, historically, this is also how ancient populations in the real world are often estimated, so there are some credible rules-of-thumb out there.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to take a new approach.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a long time Tolkien fan, I truly enjoyed <em><a href="https://medium.com/@lymanstone/how-many-hobbits-a-demographic-analysis-of-middle-earth-cd53b91d141f">How Many Hobbits? A Demographic Analysis of Middle Earth</a></em>.</p>

      <title>The American Style of quotation mark punctuation makes no sense</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.endore.it/Arretrati/9/Articoli/SuTolkienELeFiabe.pdf&#34;&gt;translated&lt;/a&gt; an essay by Terry Windling, &lt;a href=&#34;https://accademia.tolkieniana.net/tesi/endicott/tlkefiabeng.html&#34;&gt;On Tolkien and
Fairie-Stories&lt;/a&gt;, from American English to Italian. I remember arguing with
the author about her use of periods in quotations. Each quotation would end
with a period before the closing mark. I was puzzled. We don&amp;rsquo;t do that in
Italy. More importantly, I read many English texts where the period was left
outside the quotation itself. She insisted that her style was correct&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Years ago, I <a href="http://www.endore.it/Arretrati/9/Articoli/SuTolkienELeFiabe.pdf">translated</a> an essay by Terry Windling, <a href="https://accademia.tolkieniana.net/tesi/endicott/tlkefiabeng.html">On Tolkien and

<p>Today I learn that, in English, there are in fact two different and conflicting
quotation mark punctuation styles: American and British.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are different ways of combining quotation and punctuation marks. In the
American style, you almost always put periods and commas inside the quotation
marks [&hellip;] In the British style, however, you put periods and commas outside
the quotation marks, unless they are part of a complete sentence that is
fully contained between the quotation marks:</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/the-american-style-of-quotation-mark-punctuation-makes-no-sense">The American Style of Quotation Mark Punctuation Makes No Sense</a> the
author illustrates the differences between the two styles, then argues that
&ldquo;the British approach makes more sense, so use that one.&rdquo; Whoops.</p>

<p>In my rendition I moved the period after the end mark. Different languages, different rules.
