      <description>Dan Goodin at Ars Tecnica, on multifactor authentication (2FA/MFA):
Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a core defense that is among the most effective at preventing account takeovers. In addition to requiring that users provide a username and password, MFA ensures they must also use an additional factor—be it a fingerprint, physical security key, or one-time password—before they can access an account. Nothing in this article should be construed as saying MFA isn’t anything other than essential.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>That said, some forms of MFA are stronger than others, and recent events show
that these weaker forms aren’t much of a hurdle for some hackers to clear. In
the past few months, suspected script kiddies like the Lapsus$ data extortion
gang and elite Russian-state threat actors (like Cozy Bear, the group behind
the SolarWinds hack) have both successfully defeated the protection.</p>

The article is solid. It first introduces the various forms of MFA, then
explains the attack vectors used to bypass them (hint: they prey on distracted,
busy, or otherwise unaware people - we&rsquo;ve all been there.) I appreciate their
stressing that MFA is essential while raising awareness of the potential
pitfalls.</p>
