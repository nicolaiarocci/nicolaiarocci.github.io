Inspired by the historic Dahomey Amazons and founded by three of the biggest powerhouses in African music, Mamani Keïta, Mariam Doumbia, and Oumou Sangare, Les Amazones d&rsquo;Afrique have been using their voices to advocate for women&rsquo;s rights since their 2017 debut. The group has never shied away from mashing up tradition and technology. Still, on Musow Dance, with the endlessly inventive production of Jacknife Lee, they lean heavily into an almost entirely electronic sound, turning up the energy several notches with booming 808s, dramatic synth slides, and bursts of vintage disco. But none of these additions ever overshadow the true soul of the music, instead amplifying the already formidable voices of Les Amazones d&rsquo;Afrique&rsquo;s ever-evolving lineup (source)."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/kuma-fo-by-les-amazones-dafrique/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon16x16.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon32x32.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=mask-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/kuma-fo-by-les-amazones-dafrique/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://nicolaiarocci.com/kuma-fo-by-les-amazones-dafrique/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nicola Iarocci"><meta property="og:title" content="Kuma Fo by Les Amazones D'Afrique"><meta property="og:description" content=" Inspired by the historic Dahomey Amazons and founded by three of the biggest powerhouses in African music, Mamani Keïta, Mariam Doumbia, and Oumou Sangare, Les Amazones d’Afrique have been using their voices to advocate for women’s rights since their 2017 debut.

say\nIs worth listening to\nLife is hard, I fight with courage, let me be\nWhatever they say\nWhatever women have to say\nIs worth listening to\nYou know, my life is mine, so give me space\nThe world

wonder how we’ll make it?\nChorus\nYou light up life\nYou light up life\nTo educate a woman is to educate a village\nTo educate a girl is to educate the world\nGet up, get up, get up\nRegain your feminine strength\nWoman, woman, woman, get up, get up\nRegain your feminine strength\nI travelled to the North\nPeople from the North told me\nThat women have dignity\nI travelled to the West\nPeople
