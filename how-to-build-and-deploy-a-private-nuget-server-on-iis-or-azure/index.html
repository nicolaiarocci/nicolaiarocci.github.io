Packaging is not new. The practice is considered to be well settled, even in the .NET community where it became mainstream in relatively recent times with the advent of NuGet (2010). Nonetheless, I have seen the discussion going oh so many times, even in recent times, in shops big and small: should we package in the first place? Yes you should.\nYou don’t want to just get along with loose .dll files being distributed (zipped or not) by hand, email, or any other means. We have all done it at some point or another. Over time even that single, very simple, self-contained library file is going to outgrow itself. New releases will happen. Some of those releases might happen to be outright broken. Bugs and/or regressions will surface. They always do. Maybe your library will take on a few dependencies. Good luck getting all your peers to upgrade or downgrade painlessly.\nAnd yes I know. Nowadays we have version control systems. A team can simply share code via git. But often times you don’t necessarily want/can share the code with your colleagues. More importantly, in most scenarios your peers only need the features that your library offers, not the burden that comes with adding your project to their solution and then keeping their clones up to date. They simply need to add a reference to your library. It might make sense to keep everything fluid (no release, no package) at the very early stages, when your API is not ironed out yet but really, just don’t. Especially so if you can rely on a private NuGet feed which you can setup to allow for all kind of dirty (and inadvisable) tricks, like enabling package overwriting which is disabled on the public feed.\nPackages are the way to go. They give you versioning and dependency management. They also encorage a distribution model made of small, mostly self-contained files, which is both a best and common pattern (just look at the path taken by Microsoft itself with the .NET Core distribution model).\nThe case for private NuGet feeds Now, with that out of the way, let’s give a look at the official NuGet feed. According to the NuGet blog itself:\nNuGet.org is growing blazingly fast. The past couple of years have seen a tremendous growth in the usage of packages from the NuGet gallery.\nBut let’s just dig into that giant haystack for a little while. Just a quick glance will suffice to determine that the feed is a big mess. Besides the top packages, the tip of the iceberg, you will easily spot a whole lot of packages that are clearly intended to be only consumed by a handful of people. Descriptions are often very short, to the point of being unintelligible. Sometimes they are totally (purposely?) cryptic, or just speak some kind of internal lingo. Heck, even the package names are at times so obscure that I don’t even get a hint at what they are supposed to do.\nMind you, this is not limited to the NuGet ecosystem. If we look at the Python Package Index for example, we find the same exact situation: 95K+ packages, many of which are totally unintelligible unless you know what you are looking for. And don’t get me started with npm, which reigns supreme with its astounding 350,000 packages count.\nI cannot help but think that many packages would better sit in a private NuGet server. I would not be surprised to learn one day that people are publishing to the public feed just because they don’t know they can build their own private server or, even if they do, they think it is just not worth the effort.\nPrivate servers are not a tool just for the enterprise. Small teams will benefit from them too. Aside from the obvious we don’t want/can’t share our packages with the public there are other good reasons to have one. Setting a server up is cheap (host on IIS or Azure), easy, and allows you total control over the feed.\nPrivate NuGet feed options The NuGet framework supports local feeds with three options:\nLocal feed. This is a suitable network file share used to store your pages. Very simple. Probably a good solution if you don’t need to share your packages outside your LAN. NuGet.Server. Packages are made available through a HTTP server, local or remote. NuGet Gallery. Packages are hosted using the NuGet Gallery Project available on GitHub. This is the same tool used to host the official feed, with all the features like web browsing and searching, admin interface, etc. There are also third-party NuGet hosting services that support remote private feeds.\nIn this article we will look at NuGet.Server option. This is an actual package provided by the .NET Foundation. It creates an ASP.NET application that can host a package feed on any server that runs IIS. It is simple and quick to setup, and it is ideal for small teams and simple scenarios. Its biggest drawback is that it does not keep state: it does not rely on a local database to store download counts, user logins, etc. If you need that level of detail then you want to look at the NuGet Gallery option. What the NuGet.Server packages does, in practice, is making a folder on the server available through HTTP(S). Visual Studio and nuget.exe can then add the server to the list of available sources and consume it along with other feeds, like the public one.\nIf you played with NuGet.Server in the past and found it slow for large number of packets, please give it another shot now. Besides some internal optimizations, in recent times it has been updated to use the Expanded Folder Format and its performance has skyrocketed since then.\nCreate a NuGet Server in Visual Studio In Visual Studio select File \u003e New \u003e Project to create a new project. In order to get the latest version of NuGet.Server, make sure you set the target framework to .NET Framework 4.6 or above.\nGive the application an appropriate name and click OK. In the following dialog pick the Empty ASP.NET Web Application template and click OK.\nNext you need to install the NuGet.Server package itself. Right-click the project name and select Manage NuGet Packages. In the NuGet Package Manager search and install the latest version of NuGet.Server.\nAlternatively, you can of course install from the Package Manager Console with Install-Package NuGet.Server.\nThe installation process will install the needed dependencies and take care of converting your empty application into an actual package server. It achieves that by overwriting the default web.config to include custom application settings (to which we will get in a second), and by creating a deafult Packages folder where your packages will reside. When you are asked if you want to overwrite the current web.config, say YES.\nWhen the process is complete your server is ready to run. Just hit Ctrl+F5 (no debug) and Edge will fire up at the following page:\nAdding packages to the feed Now, if you go back to the project and inspect the newly created Packages folder, you will find that it is empty except for a readme file, which makes sense since we have not added any package to our repository yet. The readme says that you can simply drag (or paste) your .nupkg files into the folder in order to make them available to clients.\nThat works. I suspect, though, that it used to work better back when NuGet Server did not support the Expanded Folder Format. At the time of this writing (v2.11.3 of the package), dragging packages is an awkward process for a couple of reasons. First, you also need to remember to set the Copy to Output Directory property to Copy Always for every file added this way (that’s not mentioned in the readme). Second, as soon as the app is up and runnig it will reconstruct the folder by moving package files, each one into their own sub-folder, as the Expanded Folder Format implies. This will leave your project with orphaned files. My suggestion is to simply use your newly created server the way it is supposed to be: just push your packages to it via nuget.exe.\nInitially your NuGet Server will not allow clients to push packages. You first need to set an API key in web.config, then clients will need to use the key when pushing to the server. As you can see, the apiKey value is blank by default.\nThe key will have to be shared by all clients, so make sure you hand it only to authorized personnel. While you are at it, also make sure that it as strong as it can get. And yes I agree. Along with being statless, the shared API key requirement is probably the biggest drawback to the NuGet.Server option.\nIf your server is secured by other means (e.g. it sits in a firewalled company network), or if you just want to perform some local testing, you can switch the API key requirement off by setting requireApiKey to false.\nOnce your API key is properly configured you can start pushing from the command line:\nnuget.exe push {package file} {apikey} -Source http://localhost:50227/api/v2/package As you can see are still running on localhost. It’s almost time to publish our NuGet server to IIS or Azure. Let’s first give a look at a couple interesting options we have in web.config.\nAllow overriding on Push As I mentioned in my ramblings above, a private feed offers some more control over the feed compared to the public one. On nuget.org you cannot override an existing package version, period. On you own server you have to option to allow that. Just set allowOverrideExistingPackageOnPush to true (it is disabled by default, and for good reasons).\nSoft deletes (delist) When a client has a valid API key it can not only push, but also delete packages. By default the delete command will do just that, delete the package file from the repository. On your server you can change that behavior and opt for delisting on delete instead. Just set enableDelisting to true.\nBe careful however as a delisted package can still be donwloaded by clients that explictly specify the version, as correctly reported in the comments for the option.\nChange the default folder If you dislike ~/Packages as your packages repository, you can set packagesPath to something other than the default blamk value. This can be a virtual or physical path.\nDeploy to IIS or Azure There is nothing special about deploying the server application to either IIS or Azure. It is just a normal web application and we can leverage Visual Studio’s Web Deploy feature to achieve our goal.\nIn the Solution Explorer right click on the project name and hit Publish. In the Publish dialog, if you are publishing to Azure select Microsoft App Service. Sign-if if you need to, and then pick an appropriate service name.\nHit Publish. At the end of the process Edge will open your remote welcome page.\nYou can start to push packages right away.\nIf publishing to IIS in the Publish dialog select the Custom option and fill in server name (IP address works too), site name, username and password. The Destination URL is not strictly necessary. When I first tried this, pushes were failing despite the server app being up and running. The issue was that the application did not have write access to the Packages folder, so you might want to check that too.\nConsume the feed from Visual Studio Once your server is up and running you can add it as a NuGet Source in Visual Studio. Go to Tools \u003e Options and browse to NuGet Package Manager \u003e Package Sources. Alternatively, right click on the project in the Solution Explorer, hit Manage NuGet Packages and then hit the gear icon next to the Package Source combo.\nAdd your server to the list of available sources. As you can see in my case I have nuget.org, a local folder and the test server for this article available. Hit OK once your server has been added. At this point when you go to the NuGet Package Manager window your Package source combo will also list your private server and you can install packages from there.\nThe screenshot above is from Visual Studio for Mac. It shows the actual private feed we use for development. All our packages are nicely listed there, with no interference from the public feed. The public feed is only one click away and, both on Mac and Windows, you can search on all available feeds at once, wich is super convenient.\nWrap up NuGet.Server makes setting up a private NuGet feed a breeze. It does have a few drawbacks. If you can live with it being stateless and not allowing for individual API keys, then this package is probably your best option. The full NuGet Gallery project is still available if you need more power.\nIf you want to get in touch, I am @nicolaiarocci on Twitter.\nSpecial thanks to fellow Microsft MVP \u0026 Regional Director Andrea Saltarello for peer reviewing this article before publication.\n","wordCount":"2314","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2017-01-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2017-01-09T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://nicolaiarocci.com/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-private-nuget-server-on-iis-or-azure/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Nicola Iarocci","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/ accesskey=h title="Nicola Iarocci (Alt + H)"><img src=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/avatar.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Nicola Iarocci</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/opensource/ title=code><span>code</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/speaking/ title=speaking><span>speaking</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/books-i-have-read/ title=library><span>library</span></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/nicolaiarocci title=subscribe><span>subscribe</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/archives/ title=archive><span>archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How to build and deploy a private NuGet server on IIS or Azure</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2017-01-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 9, 2017</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Recently I had to build and deploy a private NuGet server.

search and install the latest version of NuGet.Server.</p><p><img alt="Install the NuGet.Server package" loading=lazy src=/images/nuget-server-2.png></p><p>Alternatively, you can of course install from the Package Manager Console with
<code>Install-Package NuGet.Server</code>.</p><p>The installation process will install the needed dependencies and take care of
converting your empty application into an actual package server. It achieves
that by overwriting the default <code>web.config</code> to include custom application
settings (to which we will get in a second), and by creating a deafult
<code>Packages</code> folder where your packages will reside. When you are asked if you
want to overwrite the current <code>web.config</code>, say YES.</p><p>When the process is complete your server is ready to run. Just hit Ctrl+F5 (no
debug) and Edge will fire up at the following page:</p><p><img alt="NuGet server up and running" loading=lazy src=/images/nuget-server-3.png></p><h2 id=adding-packages-to-the-feed>Adding packages to the feed<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#adding-packages-to-the-feed>#</a></h2><p>Now, if you go back to the project and inspect the newly created <code>Packages</code>
folder, you will find that it is empty except for a readme file, which
makes sense since we have not added any package to our repository yet. The readme
says that you can simply drag (or paste) your <code>.nupkg</code> files into the folder in
order to make them available to clients.</p><p>That works. I suspect, though, that it used to work better back when
NuGet Server did not support the Expanded Folder Format. At the time of this
writing (v2.11.3 of the package), dragging packages is an awkward process for
a couple of reasons. First, you also need to remember to set the Copy to Output
Directory property to <em>Copy Always</em> for every file added this way (that&rsquo;s not
mentioned in the readme). Second, as soon as the app is up and runnig it will
reconstruct the folder by moving package files, each one into their own
sub-folder, as the Expanded Folder Format implies. This will leave your project
with orphaned files. My suggestion is to simply use your newly created server
the way it is supposed to be: just push your packages to it via <code>nuget.exe</code>.</p><p>Initially your NuGet Server will not allow clients to push packages. You first
need to set an API key in <code>web.config</code>, then clients will need to use the key
when pushing to the server. As you can see, the <code>apiKey</code> value is blank by
default.</p><p><img alt="NuGet API key setting in web.config" loading=lazy src=/images/nuget-server-4.png></p><p>The key will have to be shared by all clients, so make sure you hand it only to
authorized personnel. While you are at it, also make sure that it as strong as
it can get. And yes I agree. Along with being statless, the shared API key
requirement is probably the biggest drawback to the NuGet.Server option.</p><p>If your server is secured by other means (e.g. it sits in a firewalled
company network), or if you just want to perform some local testing, you can
switch the API key requirement off by setting <code>requireApiKey</code> to <code>false</code>.</p><p>Once your API key is properly configured you can start pushing from the command
line:</p><pre><code>nuget.exe push {package file} {apikey} -Source http://localhost:50227/api/v2/package 
</code></pre><p>As you can see are still running on localhost. It&rsquo;s almost time to publish our
NuGet server to IIS or Azure. Let&rsquo;s first give a look at a couple interesting
options we have in <code>web.config</code>.</p><h2 id=allow-overriding-on-push>Allow overriding on Push<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#allow-overriding-on-push>#</a></h2><p>As I mentioned in my ramblings above, a private feed offers some more
control over the feed compared to the public one. On nuget.org you cannot override an
existing package version, period. On you own server you have to option to allow
that. Just set <code>allowOverrideExistingPackageOnPush</code> to <code>true</code> (it is disabled by
default, and for good reasons).</p><h2 id=soft-deletes-delist>Soft deletes (delist)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#soft-deletes-delist>#</a></h2><p>When a client has a valid API key it can not only push, but also delete
packages. By default the <code>delete</code> command will do just that, delete the package
file from the repository. On your server you can change that behavior and opt
for delisting on <code>delete</code> instead. Just set <code>enableDelisting</code> to <code>true</code>.</p><p>Be careful however as a delisted package can still be donwloaded by clients
that explictly specify the version, as correctly reported in the comments for
the option.</p><h2 id=change-the-default-folder>Change the default folder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#change-the-default-folder>#</a></h2><p>If you dislike <code>~/Packages</code> as your packages repository, you can set
<code>packagesPath</code> to something other than the default blamk value. This can be
a virtual or physical path.</p><h2 id=deploy-to-iis-or-azure>Deploy to IIS or Azure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#deploy-to-iis-or-azure>#</a></h2><p>There is nothing special about deploying the server application to either IIS
or Azure. It is just a normal web application and we can leverage Visual
Studio&rsquo;s Web Deploy feature to achieve our goal.</p><p>In the Solution Explorer right click on the project name and hit Publish. In
the Publish dialog, if you are publishing to Azure select Microsoft App
Service. Sign-if if you need to, and then pick an appropriate service name.</p><p><img alt="Ready to deploy on Azure" loading=lazy src=/images/nuget-server-5.png></p><p>Hit Publish. At the end of the process Edge will open your remote welcome page.</p><p><img alt="The NuGet server is up and running on Azure" loading=lazy src=/images/nuget-server-6.png></p><p>You can start to push packages right away.</p><p>If publishing to IIS in the Publish dialog select the Custom option and fill in
server name (IP address works too), site name, username and password. The
Destination URL is not strictly necessary. When I first tried this, pushes were
failing despite the server app being up and running. The issue was that the
application did not have write access to the Packages folder, so you might want
to check that too.</p><h2 id=consume-the-feed-from-visual-studio>Consume the feed from Visual Studio<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#consume-the-feed-from-visual-studio>#</a></h2><p>Once your server is up and running you can add it as a NuGet Source in Visual
Studio. Go to Tools > Options and browse to NuGet Package Manager > Package
Sources. Alternatively, right click on the project in the Solution Explorer,
hit Manage NuGet Packages and then hit the gear icon next to the Package Source
combo.</p><p><img alt="NuGet sources in Visual Studio" loading=lazy src=/images/nuget-server-7.png></p><p>Add your server to the list of available sources. As you can see in my case
I have nuget.org, a local folder and the test server for this article
available. Hit OK once your server has been added. At this point when you go to
the NuGet Package Manager window your Package source combo will also list your
private server and you can install packages from there.</p><p><img alt="NuGet server in VS for Mac" loading=lazy src=/images/nuget-server-8.png></p><p>The screenshot above is from Visual Studio for Mac. It shows the actual private
feed we use for development. All our packages are nicely listed there, with no
interference from the public feed. The public feed is only one click away and,
both on Mac and Windows, you can search on all available feeds at once, wich is
super convenient.</p><h2 id=wrap-up>Wrap up<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#wrap-up>#</a></h2><p>NuGet.Server makes setting up a private NuGet feed a breeze. It does have a few
drawbacks. If you can live with it being stateless and not allowing for
individual API keys, then this package is probably your best option. The full
NuGet Gallery project is still available if you need more power.</p><p>If you want to get in touch, I am @<a href=http://twitter.com/nicolaiarocci>nicolaiarocci</a> on Twitter.</p><p><em>Special thanks to fellow Microsft MVP & Regional Director <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/it-it/PublicProfile/8464?fullName=andrea%20saltarello">Andrea
