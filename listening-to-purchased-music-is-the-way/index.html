MP3 player app with few well-thought-out features.
I am increasingly convinced that returning to purchased music is the
way.
I&rsquo;ve been listening to streaming services for so long that I almost forgot the
accomplishment of listening to music I own. This music was so significant when I
first listened to it that it was worth buying and carrying along over the years.
It&rsquo;s tangible, too: it&rsquo;s sitting right next to me, on my hard disk and my phone;
I can look at it and, yes, touch and move it as I please, as I can with my
original CDs.
