In an attempt to learn more about the so-called Web3 and the technologies
around it, he went all-in and built a couple of dApps himself. Then, he
produced an NFT and put it up for sale. What he found is, well, to put it
mildly, fascinating.
Some of his insights on technology are also interesting. For example, on

Even relatively simple apps require a group of people to sit in front of a computer for eight hours a day, every day, forever. This wasn’t always the case, and there was a time when 50 people working on a software project wasn’t considered a “small team.” As long as software requires such concerted energy and so much highly specialized human focus, I think it will have the tendency to serve the interests of the people sitting in that room every day rather than what we may consider our broader goals.\nMy foray into cryptocurrencies and blockchain happened almost ten years ago when the craze started. After a few experiments, I tagged it all as a nerds game and moved away. Moxie’s article served me well in catching up on the whole scene.
