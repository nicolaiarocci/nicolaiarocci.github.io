<meta name=keywords content="speaking,devromagna,llm"><meta name=description content="Last night, I presented a session titled MCP or Connecting our Apps to LLMs at DevRomagna, our local developer&rsquo;s community, and I think it went well.
I had intended to record the audio with the idea of transcribing it with MacWhisper and then publishing it here on my site, but I forgot to do so, which is a pity.
The session lasted almost two hours (I had thought it would take less time), during which I deviated somewhat from the script, using slides as a guide that were essentially an adaptation of the notes I had taken during my experiments. I showed the code for the MCP servers I created (stdio and streamable HTTP transports), demonstrated the various ways to link them with LLMs (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and VS Code), and then shared my thoughts on the entire matter."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/mcp-or-connecting-our-apps-to-llms/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon16x16.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon32x32.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><link rel=mask-icon href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/mcp-or-connecting-our-apps-to-llms/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://nicolaiarocci.com/mcp-or-connecting-our-apps-to-llms/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nicola Iarocci"><meta property="og:title" content="MCP or connecting our apps to LLMs"><meta property="og:description" content="Last night, I presented a session titled MCP or Connecting our Apps to LLMs at DevRomagna, our local developer’s community, and I think it went well.
