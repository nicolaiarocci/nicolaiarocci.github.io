You want to build some applications that almost, but not quite, work. I suspect better LLM “brains” are coming soon, in the form of GPT-5 and Gemini 2.0 and many others. When they do, you can swap them into the almost-but-not-quite-working applications for a fast start. This is similar to the philosophy of the big AI labs, which build ambitious solutions (OpenAI’s GPT agents, Google’s connections to Gmail) which will benefit when the next version of their core LLMs are released.\nSo don’t just build for what is possible today, but what is possible in six months, if this pace of change continues. At this point, I think things are unlikely to slow down in the near future, and focusing on where things are heading, rather than where they are, prepares you for a world of continuing change.\n– Ethan Mollick\n","wordCount":"259","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-20T14:54:06+01:00","dateModified":"2024-02-20T14:54:06+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://nicolaiarocci.com/quoting-ethan-mollick/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Nicola Iarocci","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://nicolaiarocci.com/images/avatar.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/opensource/ title=code><span>code</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/speaking/ title=speaking><span>speaking</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/books-i-have-read/ title=library><span>library</span></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/nicolaiarocci title="mailing list"><span>mailing list</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/index.xml title=rss><span>rss</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/archives/ title=archive><span>archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nicolaiarocci.com/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Quoting Ethan Mollick</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-20 14:54:06 +0100 CET'>February 20, 2024</span></div></header><div class=post-content><blockquote><p>Many skeptics about the impact of AI are focused on the flaws that LLMs have today: hallucinations, short context windows, slow answers, and so on.
